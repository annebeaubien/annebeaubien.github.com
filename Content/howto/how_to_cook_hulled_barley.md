description: Hulled barley packs a whopping 32 grams of dietary fiber and 23 grams of protein in a 1 cup serving! Try using it in place of brown rice sometime or add it to soups instead of noodles.

This is the least processed form of barley, only the outer husk has been removed, making it the most nutritious form of the grain. The downside of hulled barley is that is has about 3 times as many calories as brown rice, but in exchange it is packed full of dietary fiber and protein. Try using it sparingly in place of brown rice, I would suggest having 1/4 cup serving per person based on the calories. The benefit is you will not need much to feel full since it has SO much fiber!

**Instructions:**

There are two ways to cook barley, you can either measure out the ingredients exacly and you should end up with no water left in the pan at the end. Or you can throw some barley into a pan, cover it with more than 6 parts water and cook it until it is soft (40 minutes) then strain off the excess water. Both methods work great but the second one is nice because you don't have to worry about potentially running out of water if the heat is a little too high.  1. Combine the barley and water in a large saucepan and bring to a rolling boil. Continue to boil for 2-3 minutes. Then turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for another 40 minutes. 

1. Remove from heat and let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb the excess water. Barley is finished when it is soft and chewy. Do not worry if there is extra water left in the pan when the barley is finished, just strain it in a colander.
