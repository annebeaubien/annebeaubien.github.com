description: Home-made almond milk tastes shockingly different from store-bought; it is super almond-y. Plus home-made does not have all the sugars and stabilizers that store-bought has. It only takes a few seconds in the blender and voila, almond milk that is rich in vitamin E, manganese and omega-6.

The basic almond milk formula is 1 part almonds to 3 parts water. From there you can add whatever extras you want; chocolate, vanilla, strawberries, or even dates for a little sweetness. The choice is yours.

If you are using a Vitamix you can place everything right into it and blend on high. However if using a regular blender or stick blender, you are going to need to soak the almonds for about 6 hours. If there is a chance you might forget about the soaking almonds or not get back to them for longer than 8 hours, you might want to put them into the fridge to soak. Once I forgot about the almonds for almost 16 hours and came back to fermented almonds. Yum.

If you are going to be drinking this almond milk you will want to strain it, however if you are cooking or smoothies it is fine to leave it unstrained. If you strain it you are removing a lot of the good fiber that lives in the flesh of the almonds so leave it in if you can.
