Fall is a season full of mysterious fruits: persimmons, quinces, all manner of squashes and of course pomegranates. Don’t be afraid to try something new just because it’s unfamiliar. Follow these easy steps and you will be eating sweet, juicy, pomegranate seeds in no time.

**Makes:** about 1 cup of seeds

**Preparation time:** 10m  
**Cooking time:** 10m  
**Total time:** 10m

**Ingredients:**

**Equipment:** large bowl, large knife

**Instructions:**

1. Fill a large bowl 3/4 full of water.
1. Cut the pomegranate in half with a sharp knife. Some red juice will come out. It can stain some countertops and wooden cutting boards so make sure to use a cutting board that you don’t mind having a stain; otherwise use a plate. As far as wooden boards are concerned the stain will fade over time.
1. Submerge the two pomegranate halves in the bowl. Now use your hands to break them apart while keeping them underwater. Keeping them submerged contains the spray so you don’t end up with bright red splatters all over your walls. Continue to break apart the pomegranate and separate the seeds from the pith. The seeds will sink to the bottom of the bowl while the pith and other inedible parts will float. Skim these inedible parts off the top and then pour the remaining water and seeds into a colander. You should end up with a colander full of juicy pomegranate seeds!
1. Eat them strait up or try them in a recipe like my Spiced Pomegranate Smoothie.
