**Instructions:**

There are two ways to cook barley, you can either measure out the ingredients exacly and you should end up with no water left in the pan at the end. Or you can throw some barley into a pan, cover it with more than 3 parts water and cook it until it is soft (30 minutes) then strain off the excess water. Both methods work great but the second one is nice because you don't have to worry about potentially running out of water if your boil is too high.  1. Place the pearled barley and water into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil then turn the heat down and simmer for 30 minutes. 

1. Remove from heat and let it sit for 10 minutes to absorb the excess water. Barley is finished when it is soft and chewy. Do not worry if there is extra water left in the pan when the barley is finished, just strain it in a colander.
