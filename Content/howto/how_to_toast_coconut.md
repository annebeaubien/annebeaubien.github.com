The character of coconut changes when it is toasted. The taste intensifies and the texture becomes very crunchy. Eating toasted coconut is quite an enjoyable experience. When I have my morning oatmeal, am I looking forward to the oatmeal? No...I look forward to the crispy coconut on top. Best of all, unsweetened coconut flakes have a decent amount of fiber and manganese, but go easy on them, they are also a good source of saturated fat. A little goes a long way.

**Instructions:**

1. Heat a dry frying pan over medium-high heat. 
1. Add the coconut flakes and swirl them around in the pan by grabbing the handle and moving it in a circular motion. 
1. In about 30 seconds take the pan by the handle and shake the pan forward and back to flip the coconut flakes over. Then swirl the coconut around again, and wait another 30 seconds. Keep doing this until the coconut flakes begin to become fragrant (1-2 minutes). 
1. Then start flipping and swirling every 10 second until the coconut flakes change color from ivory to golden brown. Remove from the heat and pour them into a bowl so they do not continue to cook.
