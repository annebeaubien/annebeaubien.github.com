description: Make wheatgrass juice without a juicer in two easy steps: blend and strain.
---
If you have a juicer you don't need to read this post. These instructions are for those who want wheatgrass juice but don’t have a juicer and don't want to pay the high price of getting it freshly squeezed or buying pre-made frozen cubes for $1+ per ounce. The wheatgrass juice produced with the following instructions is less concentrated than pure pressed wheatgrass because you have to water it down to blend it. With pressed wheatgrass 1 ounce is the recommend serving size, however made this way I would say that 2 ounces (1/4 cup) is better estimate.

Wheatgrass juice doesn’t stay fresh for long so to get the most nutrients out of it I recommend blending as needed and consuming right away or immediately freezing it into cubes for later use. Most people don’t say what the time limit is but I have seen some estimates say that it only stays fresh for about 30 minutes.

You can either acquire wheatgrass either at your local health food store, or farmers market, or you can grow your own (see link below). Wheatgrass is probably the easiest thing you will ever attempt to grow, and one of the most cost effective. It will grow in any container in nearly any climate or lighting condition and is ready to harvest in 7 days. If you are buying wheatgrass at the store, chances are the smallest amount you can get is 1 pound (about 12 cups). That’s a LOT of wheatgrass. Since it is best consumed fresh you should leave it in grass form until ready to drink or freeze. I like to blend big batches and freeze them into ice cubes right away.

**Equipment:** blender, nut milk bag or cheese cloth

**Instructions:**

1. Place the wheatgrass into a blender in equal parts i.e. 1 cup wheatgrass/1 cup water, or 1/2 cup wheatgrass/1/2 cup water, etc. Blend on high until all of the wheatgrass is well blended.
1. Place a nut milk bag or cheese cloth over a cup or bowl the appropriate size for the amount of juice you made. Then slowly pour the liquid through the bag into the container. This strains off all of the indigestible wheatgrass fibers. (If you are putting the wheatgrass into a smoothie you can skip this step. The fibers are indigestible - similar to the casing on corn kernels - but they not bad for you).
1. Immediately drink or freeze.
