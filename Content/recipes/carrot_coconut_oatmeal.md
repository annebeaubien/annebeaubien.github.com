description: In this crazy breakfast carrots, kale and zucchini are rounded up and tossed into a slow-cooker over night with oats, coconut milk and heart-warming spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. It makes for a hearty, healthy, keep-you-full until lunch treat that you are going to want to eat all week. Maybe this will make you rethink veggies for breakfast!

I don’t normally make recipes with quite so many servings, however this is one that I like to make a big batch of on Sunday night and then enjoy it throughout the week. You put it in the slow-cooker the night before so it is ready by the time you wake up. This also works well if you have kids or house guests and need a quick breakfast in the morning.

I tested this recipe with both rolled oats and steel cut oats. The rolled oats pretty much disintegrated after 6 hours in the slow cooker so it made a big bowl of mush. It was still tasty but didn’t quite have the desired texture. Therefore, I recommend using steel cut oats. They hold together better and give it a nice chewy texture. 

You can grease the sides of the slow-cooker before you add the ingredients if you wish, but it is not necessary. The oatmeal will probably stick to the sides a little, depending on your slow-cooker. I’d recommend using a little non-stick spray or coconut oil if you use anything, but don’t feel like you have to, I never do.

*Gluten-Free: oats are naturally gluten-free, however they are usually processed on the same equipment as wheat and other gluten containing grains. If you are following a strict gluten-free diet then make sure to buy gluten-free oats. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers them. If you only have a minor gluten allergy then you may be fine with regular oats.

- 8 pitted dates (chopped)
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract (or 1 teaspoon almond extract and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/2 cup toasted coconut (optional)

**Equipment:** slow cooker

**Instructions:**

1. First, you need to chop/shred the carrot and zucchini. You can do this several ways, either: 1. use a knife and cut into small pieces, 2. use a cheese grater to shred it, 3. place them into a blender/food processor and use the chop setting. 
1. Place the shredded carrot and zucchini into a slow cooker, along with the oats, kale, coconut milk, water, chopped dates, ground flax seeds, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and nutmeg. 
1. Cook on low for 6-8 hours (depending on your slow-cooker). Some slow-cookers are hotter than others, and some have a "keep warm" setting. If yours has a "keep warm" setting that kicks in automatically after the cooking time finishes, then I recommend using this and setting the timer for 6 hours. That way it'll still be warm when you get up after a full night's sleep. 
1. Serve with toasted coconut, toasted nuts and raisins and let people add as much as they want. I add about 1 tablespoon of each (coconut, nuts and raisins) to each serving.


My recipe was inspired by the “Vegan Carrot Cake & Zucchini Bread Oatmeal” recipe from Kathy Hester's cookbook, The Vegan Slow Cooker.
