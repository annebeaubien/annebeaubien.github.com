As a mom with two kids who have opposite opinions on everything I am a big fan of meals that allow everyone to add what they like. The base of this meal is a potato soup, and everything else is optional and served in separate bowls. I even recommend blending half the soup and serving it as two separate soups because my son wants chuncky potato soup and my daughter wants creamy potato soup...of course. When you are finished cooking each part I recommend putting them into idividual serving dishes and into a warm oven (put it on your ovens lowest possible temp) to keep them warm until everything is ready. 

**Makes:** 4 servings

**Instructions:**

1. Heat a large saucepan over medium-high. Then brown the **beef**. 
1. Remove the beef from the pan to a bowl, cover and keep warm. 
1. Pour the **vegetable stock** and **bone broth** into the large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Then add the **potatoes** and cook for 12 minutes then turn off the heat.
1. Meanwhile, remove 1 cup of vegetable stock and put it in the small saucepan with the chopped **chard leaves**. Cook the chard leaves for a couple of minutes until it is soft then remove them to a separate bowl, cover and keep warm. Then strain the stock back into the large saucepan. 
1. Add 1-2 Tablespoons **olive oil** to the small saucepan and saut√© the **carrots** and **chard ribs** over medium heat until they start to brown on the edges (5-10min)
1. Just before serving place half of the potato soup in a blender and blend until smooth. Serve the soup in 2 separate containers so that people can pick either chunky or smooth, or chose to mix them. Serve with any other items your family likes that would be good in soup. We chose corn, peas, shredded cheese, and hot sauce. Each person can add what they want to build their own meal.
