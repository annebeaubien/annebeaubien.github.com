description: These scones are easy and delicious!

I love how easy it is to work with this dough, but a big part of what makes it easy is having the right tools. If you are going to make scones, you should absolutely get yourself a pastry cutter, aka pastry blender. They do not cost much and you will be surprised how much easier it is to cut-in butter using one. They are much safer to use than a knife, and your scones will be flakier because you didn’t use your hands to mix in the butter.

If any scones do not get devoured on day 1, they should be frozen then reheated for maximum enjoyment. Reheat from frozen by placing in a 375ºF/195ºC oven for 7-10 minutes.

**Equipment:** 

pastry cutter, 3 half-sheet pans, 2-2.5" biscuit cutter

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 375ºF/195ºC. Line 3 half-sheet pans with parchment paper.
1. Cut **butter** into 1/2-1” chunks, then return to the fridge until needed.
1. In a large bowl sift together the **flour**, **baking** **powder**, **sugar** and **salt**.
1. Cut the **butter** into the dry mixture using a pastry cutter. Then put the dry mixture in the fridge. 
1. Measure 1 cup of **milk** into a small bowl then remove 1 tablespoon of the milk and set it aside in a small container with a brush. This will be used to brush the tops of the scones just before they go in the oven. 
1. Add the **vinegar** to the rest of the 1 cup of milk and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. 
1. In a medium bowl combine the **ground** **flax** **seeds** with 6 tablespoons of water and let sit for at least 3 minutes.
1. To the flax mixture add the **sourdough** **discard**, and **milk** **mixture**. 
1. Get the dry mixture out the fridge and add the **raisins** to it. 
1. Then pour the dry mixture on top of the wet mixture.
1. Mix with a large spoon until it gets too difficult then use your hands to kneed the dough in the bowl until all the dry mixture is absorbed. 
1. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Using just your hands, pat the dough until it is about 3/4” thick. 
1. Use a 2-2.5” biscuit cutter to cut scones. Re-roll the scraps and continue until all the dough is used. As you cut the scones place them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving at least an inch between them.
1. Brush with milk and sprinkle with Demerara sugar then bake for 20-25 minutes until they just start to turn golden. 
1. Enjoy same day or freeze and reheat from frozen at 375ºF/195ºC for 7-10 minutes.
