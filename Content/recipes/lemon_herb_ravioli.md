A quick recipe that is great for summer. 

You can make this up even faster by keeping pre-steamed veggies in your fridge. I like to steam a big batch of veggies at the beginning of the week so they are ready to toss into all kinds of recipes at the last minute. If you are using pre-steamed refrigerated veggies that you would like warmed up, you can add them to the hot ravioli water for a minute after you have removed the ravioli.
