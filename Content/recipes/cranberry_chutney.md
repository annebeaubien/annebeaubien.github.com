This recipe is adapted from the book “Fix-It and Forget It, Our Best Slow-Cooker recipes 2010”. I decreased the amount of sugar and vinegar from the original recipe in order to bring out more of the cranberry flavor. Depending on how tangy you like your chutney you can add a little more of less vinegar. I like it really sharp so I usually add more. I also replaced the crystallized ginger with fresh ginger and added ground ginger and cardamom, two of my favorite fall flavors.

This sauce can be preserved in mason jars and water bath canned. Follow the water bath canning instructions and process the sealed jars in boiling water for 10 minutes. You can multiply this recipe and make more, but if you do you will need to increase the cooking time accordingly.

**Equipment:** saucepan

**Instructions:**

1. Prepare water bath canner and jars if using, otherwise skip to step 2. Follow proper water bath canning instructions on the [Ball website.](http://www.freshpreserving.com/getting-started.aspx)
1. Combine all of the ingredient in a saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.
1. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10 minutes until the mixture is syrupy. If it is still too watery you should let it boil down a little longer. The best way to test it is by putting a little sauce onto a cold plate and see if is thick enough. It will thicken a little as it cools. 
1. As soon as it is syrupy remove the sauce from the heat and pour into a heat safe serving dish or mason jar. 
1. Use right away, store in the fridge for up to a month or preserve in canning jars and use within a year.
