description: This brain child of mine came from the desire to get more veggies into my diet in any way possible. However, I don't feel like it's necessary to eliminate meat in order to do it.

These burgers are flavorful and surely healthier than if they were made with meat alone. Serve them on whole grain or sprouted wheat burger buns alongside a fresh salad and some home-made fries for a well rounded meal.

If making this dish ditch the burger and serve it atop a salad.

**Makes:** 2

**Ingredients:**

- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary

**Instructions:**

1. Place the kale into a small saucepan with a little bit of water and steam over medium heat for 3-5 minutes.
1. Meanwhile place the rinsed white beans into a large bowl and mash with a potato masher.
1. Add the rosemary, garlic and salt to the beans and mix.
1. Drain the kale and squeeze out excess moisture.
1. Add the turkey and kale to the large bowl and mix everything together with your hands.
1. Form two equally sized patties and cook as you would a regular burger patty. I recommend either on the grill with the lid closed or in a skillet with a lid over medium high heat for 6-7 minutes on each side.
