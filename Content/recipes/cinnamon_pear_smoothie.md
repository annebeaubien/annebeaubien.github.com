description: We have been seeing a lot of organic ripe pears in our grocery store recently which makes me think it must be pear season!

As it turns out, it is NOT actually pear season, so I wasn't sure why we had been seeing an influx of organic pears in our grocery store. That was until I turned one of them over and realized that my pears are from Argentina. So much for buying local produce this week. At least my carrots, zucchini and strawberries are from the farmers market. Whether it’s pear season or not in your part of the world, I had to find a use for the dozen organic pears I just bought...well why not some summer smoothies?

This is a big smoothie for one person so I recommend sharing. You can also divide it up into two servings and have the first one, then a few hours later have the second.
