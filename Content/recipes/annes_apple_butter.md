Super easy preparation and really tasty rewards, isn't this what every recipe should be like? You can use any combination of apples that you like as long as they are cooking apples. I find that about half sweet and half tart works best. If you are unsure which apples are good for cooking just use Granny Smith's (tart) and/or Golden Delicious (sweet). You just need to have enough to fill a 6 qt slow cooker which is about 14-18 apples, depending on their general size.
