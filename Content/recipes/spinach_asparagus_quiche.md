description: Make the most of spring produce with this seasonal asparagus quiche. In the northern hemisphere, asparagus is harvested from February to June with it’s peak in April; in the southern hemisphere the peak season is from August to December (peaking in October). Don’t wait until it is too late, get asparagus while it is still in season in your hemisphere.

Did you know that at the height of asparagus season it can grow up to 2cm (almost an inch) per hour resulting in about 15cm (6 inches) in a single day. This requires them to be harvest about every 24 hours for an 8 week period. Unfortunately asparagus is not a great home crop because it takes 3 years before the plant starts to produce and it only lives about 10 years. You can tell how old the plant is by looking at the diameter of the stalks; thicker = older. 

This recipe is designed to make one individual crustless quiche in an 8oz ramekin. If you do not have ramekins you can make this in a 1 quart quiche or tart pan by increasing it to four servings. If you have ramekins that are 10-12oz add an extra egg if you are worried about it not looking right with the excess space.

Bacon makes a nice addition to this quiche. Just make sure to omit the salt if  you are adding bacon and if you are making it vegetarian don’t forget the veggie bacon.

Like many of my recipes this one uses unsweetened soy milk. You can replace this with your favorite unsweetened milk alternative (hemp, coconut, almond) or even use regular milk if you prefer. Note: Using regular milk makes this recipe no longer dairy-free.

**Ingredients:**

- 1 egg
- 1/2  cup frozen spinach (thawed, drained and excess water squeezed out)

**Equipment:** 8oz ramekin

**Instructions:**

1. If you are using bacon/veggie bacon you will need to cook that first. Otherwise skip to step 2. I like to cut it up into small pieces before cooking because then you can pull a piece out to see how crispy it is so you know when it is done. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high, place the bacon in and cook it for 5-10 mins (depending on how thick it is). Flip once while cooking. Remove from heat and drain on paper towel lined plate.
1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF/220ºC.
1. Meanwhile crack the egg into the ramekin. Sprinkle with salt (if using) and pepper and pour in the soy milk. Whisk vigorously. 
1. Stir in the thawed spinach, asparagus spears and bacon (if using). 
1. Bake at 425ºF/220ºC for 30 minutes.
