description: Did you know that Caesar salad is believed to have been invented in 1924 by an Italian who owned a restaurant in Mexico and it didn’t even have anchovies in it?! Check out this low-calorie, vegetarian Caesar salad dressing recipe.

The official Caesar salad is a mixture of greens tossed with Parmesan cheese, croutons and oddly enough, a coddle egg. This mixture is then topped with a vinaigrette dressing that is made using Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice. 

Caesar dressing is usually made with olive oil and vinegar; I have replaced the high-calorie olive oil with Greek yogurt, which also has a nice tart taste to replace the vinegar. Most people these days expect Caesar dressing to have an anchovy flavor, so I have added some umeboshi paste to the Worcestershire sauce and they serve to mimic that pickled fishy taste without being overpoweringly fishy. Use as dressing for salad or a dip for veggies. 

**Makes:** 1/2 cup (2-4 servings)

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 5m

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2  cup fat-free Greek yogurt

- 1 garlic clove (minced or pressed)
- 1 tablespoon water (more or less)
- dash lemon juice (freshly squeezed)

**Instructions:**

1. Mix the Greek yogurt, Worcestershire sauce, umeboshi paste and garlic clove in a small bowl until well blended.
1. Add water until you get the desired consistency. I find that 1 tablespoon of water is perfect for me, but maybe you like your dressing a bit thicker or thinner. Finish it off with just a dash of lemon juice. 
1. Toss with lettuce, grated Parmesan cheese and croutons and you have yourself a great Caesar salad that is healthier than those served in restaurants.
