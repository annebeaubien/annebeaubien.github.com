description: Do you like recipes that use up left-overs and cook quickly? Then this is the recipe for you.
---
As usual, it was the middle of the week, I hadn’t been to the grocery store for days and we had a bunch of random left-overs in the fridge (white wine, steamed zucchini, carrots, broccoli, and a bit of steak). I love recipes that use left-overs! I often roast or steam extra veggies when I make a meal just so there will be some left-over for the next meal, or even just to snack on later. This recipe works great with freshly cooked ingredients, or freshly re-heated ingredients.

**Equipment:**

**Instructions:**

1. If making this with rice start that cooking first. If making this with rice noodles, cooke them last (see step 4). For rice, refer to the package for cooking instructions. 
1. In a small saucepan combine the umeboshi paste, tamari, white wine, and 1/4 cup vegetable stock. Bring to a simmer then add the steak.
1. If the steak is raw then gently simmer on a very low heat while watching the water level. Add up to 1/4 cup more vegetable stock if needed. Continue until the steak is cooked through.
1. If the steak is already cooked, add it to the warm sauce then turn off the heat.
1. Slice the zucchini and carrots into roughly 1/4-inch half moons then add them to a large stock pot with the broccoli. Cover with boiling water and simmer on low for 10 minutes, or until desired tenderness is reached. Remove vegetables with a slotted spoon and place them in a large bowl. 
1. Bring the left-over vegetable water to a boil then add the rice noodles. Cook until softened. They cook very quickly so set a timer. See the package for the specific cooking instructions.
1. In a large bowl combine the par-boiled veggies, the steak, the sauce from the steak pan, and the rice noodles. Toss until well combined. 
1. Divide into two dishes and garnish with fresh ginger.
