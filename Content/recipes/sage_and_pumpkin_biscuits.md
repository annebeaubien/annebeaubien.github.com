description: Some of my favorite autumn ingredients are sage, rosemary and pumpkin. These biscuits combine all three of these flavors and compliment many seasonal meals, especially big turkey dinners!

Drop biscuits, like these, make great dinner rolls because you can make them quickly at the last minute and they are best eaten while still warm. This autumn inspired version of my Whole Wheat Drop Biscuits has earthy sage and rosemary that accompany everyones favorite fall ingredient: pumpkin! Have these biscuits alongside stuffed squash, butternut squash soup, chili, or turkey and mashed potatoes. 

This recipe is formulated for canned pumpkin purée. Home-made purée tends to have a little more liquid in it so you will need to adjust the milk substitute accordingly if you are making your own pumpkin purée.

**Makes:** 12 biscuits

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 20m

**Ingredients:**

- 10 ounces whole-wheat pastry flour (this is about 2 cups, packed and leveled)
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon dried sage
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic granules
- 1/2  teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup pumpkin purée
- 1/2 cup unsweetened milk substitute (unsweetened coconut, soy, almond, etc)

**Equipment:** baking sheets, parchment paper/silicone baking mat

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat.
1. In a large bowl, combine the whole-wheat pastry flour, baking powder, sage, rosemary, garlic powder and salt. Stir together with a fork, then add the Greek yogurt, pumpkin purée and milk substitute. Continue to stir to form the dough. It should be quite thick. Feel free to use your hands to kneed the dough until all of the dry flour is incorporated. Be careful not to over mix, stop as soon as all the flour is mixed in.
1. Using two table spoons you are going to drop the biscuits onto a baking sheet leaving about 1” between them. Use the first spoon to scoop up some of the dough (about the size of a golf ball), then use the second spoon to scrape the dough onto the baking sheet. Continue until you have used up all of the dough. You should end up with 12 biscuits.
1. Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown.
1. These are best when eaten right away but can be stored for a few days in the refrigerator. I recommend popping a couple in the oven for a few minutes to reheat them before eating.
