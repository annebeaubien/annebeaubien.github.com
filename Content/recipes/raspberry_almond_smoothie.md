This smoothie has everything you need to keep you healthy this winter. Clean protein from fat-free Greek yogurt, almonds and spinach. Antioxidants, vitamin C and fiber from juicy raspberries and of course, potassium and natural sugars for energy from bananas. 

As always, when buying frozen fruit make sure to get unsweetened, with no additives. Check the label on the bag, it should have one ingredient “raspberries”. If you do not have frozen spinach or raspberries, just use fresh and put in a couple of ice cubes to thicken and cool the smoothie. Or you can leave out the ice cubes and this drink still tastes great as a non-frozen smoothie.
