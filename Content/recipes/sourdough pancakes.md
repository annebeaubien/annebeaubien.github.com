description: A great way to use sourdough discard, and get lots of fluffy pancakes you can freeze and eat at anytime.

So many pancakes! This recipe makes SO MANY pancakes. You can easily half this recipe. I like making a lot because I want leftovers that I can freeze and eat later. YES! You CAN freeze pancakes!

A note about using sourdough discard: it is best if you last fed it 12-48 hours ago. This way it has had time to peak and is falling again. To get the right amount you should feed 100g starter, with 100g water and 100g bread or all purpose flour. You will probably use all of this so make sure you save some of your starter to feed separtely to keep.
