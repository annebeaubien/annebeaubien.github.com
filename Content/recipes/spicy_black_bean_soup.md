description: Soup season has arrived and here is another basic soup recipe that can be adapted, doctored up or enjoyed as is.

A couple times a week I enjoy this low-calorie, protein-potassium-fiber-rich soup that is ready in 10 minutes. Sometimes I even make up a large batch on Monday and enjoy it throughout the week. This soup has a kick to it, but if you do not like spicy foods just leave out the cayenne powder. You can make it into a chunky soup by adding cooked corn, broccoli, cauliflower or other veggies. I like to add greek yogurt for an added protein boost, but if you do it is no longer vegan, dairy-free or Engine 2.

**Makes:** 2  main dish or 4 appetizer

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 10m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 1/2 cups cooked black beans (or 1 15 oz can, drained and rinsed)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic granules
- 1/2  cup fat-free Greek yogurt (optional)
- 1/4  teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried minced onion (or 1/4 tsp onion powder)
- 1 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable stock


---

**Equipment:** Vitamix or regular blender and saucepan

---

**Instructions:**

1. Place the black beans, vegetable stock, dried onions, garlic powder and cayenne powder into a blender and blend on high until well mixed. 
1. If using a Vitamix: add the Greek yogurt (if using) and process on high for 5-6 minutes until steaming. 
1. If using a regular blender: pour the mixture into a sauce pan and heat to desired temperature. Then remove from the heat and let it cool for a minute before adding the Greek yogurt (if using). If you add the yogurt when the soup is too hot it will curdle. Alternatively you can serve the Greek yogurt in a separate bowl and people can add it if they want to.
