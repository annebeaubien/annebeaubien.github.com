description: This smoothie is a great source of vitamin C (orange), vitamin A & K (spinach), calcium (yogurt, orange and spinach), vitamin D & B12 (coconut milk) and folate (all of the above). So drink up and feel good about yourself for getting the nutrients your body needs.

What I really like about this calcium-rich green smoothie is that it is not very sweet. It is a little disorienting at first, but give it another sip. It will grow on you. And if you still think it is not sweet enough, toss in a small ripe banana.
