I may have put vegan in the title, but you don’t need to tell your friends. They might not even notice.

This dip always tastes better after a day in the fridge so this is a great recipe to make ahead! Enjoy with fresh veggies or whole wheat pita bread.

If you know that you don’t have a powerful blender then you should soak the cashews in the water overnight. This will help soften them so they make a smoother sauce.


**Makes:** 2 cups

**Preparation time:** 25m  
**Cooking time:** 25m  
**Total time:** 25m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup raw cashews
- 3/4 cup water
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice (1 lemon)
- 1 garlic clove
- 1-2 cucumbers (you want about 2 cups when grated)
- 1 teaspoon coarse salt
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill (finely chopped)
- 1 tablespoon fresh chives (finely chopped)

**Equipment:** blender, cheese grater, colander

---

**Instructions:**

1. Place the **cashews**, **water**, **lemon juice** and **garlic** into a blender and blend on high until smooth. You want this puree to be a smooth and as thick as greek yogurt. If you still can’t get it smooth you can strain out any larger pieces, or leave them in for a chunkier tzatziki.
1. Peel the **cucumber** then grate it using a large-hole cheese grater. 
1. Put the cucumber into a colander, sprinkle with **salt** and let it drain into a bowl/sink for 20 minutes. 
1. Then squeeze out the excess water and mix the **cucumber**, **dill** and **chives** into the cashew puree. 
1. Eat right away or chill.
