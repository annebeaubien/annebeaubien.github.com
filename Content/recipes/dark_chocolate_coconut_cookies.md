These brownie-like treats are a perfect accompaniment to a nice cup of black tea. They are gluten-free, low GI, and vegan! 

In order to melt the chocolate you are going to create a double boiler. For more detailed instructions on how to do this see my post on How To: Melt Chocolate.


**Makes:** 6-8 cookies

**Preparation time:** 10m  
**Cooking time:** 10m  
**Total time:** 40m

**Ingredients:**

- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 tablespoons coconut sugar
- 1/2 cup plain applesauce 
- 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (Make sure to get vegan bittersweet chocolate if you are making this recipe vegan. I like Dagoba.)
- 2 tablespoons virgin coconut oil
- 1/4  teaspoon fine salt (e.g. table salt)

**Equipment:** double boiler, baking sheet, parchment paper

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF/175ºC.
1. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder and set aside.
1. Create a double boiler: Fill a the large saucepan halfway with water and bring to a boil. Put the chocolate and coconut oil into the small saucepan. Once the water is boiling, turn off the heat and float the small saucepan in the large saucepan being careful not to let any water get into the small one. This will melt the chocolate without burning it because it is not continuing to be heated. Stir the chocolate and coconut oil as they melt to combine them. Continue to stir until there are no more lumps. (For more detailed instructions see [How To Melt Chocolate](https://wafflehearts.com/howtos/how_to_melt_chocolate_in_a_double_boiler)
1. Pour the chocolate mixture into a large mixing bowl.
1. Whisk in the sugar, then the applesauce.
1. Add the flour mixture and whisk until well combined.
1. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and drop spoonfuls of the cookie mixture onto it. You should get 6-8 cookies, oddly enough every time I make it I get exactly 7. 
1. Bake at 350ºF/175ºC for 25-30min. When I get 7 cookies they always need 28 minutes. At 25 they are too soft and not cooked through, and at 30 they are burnt. So I recommend baking for 25 minutes then keeping an eye on them for the next 4 min until they are done. 
1. Carefully spatula them onto a wire cooking rack and cool before eating.
