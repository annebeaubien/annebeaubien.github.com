description: Make ahead or eat right away. Summer is a great time for salads and this quinoa salad is packed with tasty, healthy ingredients and protein.

In an effort to have more quinoa in my life I’m working on some new recipes and summer salads are definitely on the menu. They are great to make ahead and have at the ready when you need a quick healthy snack or meal. And as the pregnant mom of a toddler I need quick and healthy! This recipe is full of fresh, healthy ingredient and the protein rich chicken, quinoa, and almonds will help fill you up and keep you going, whether you’re chasing a toddler, a deadline, or some other goal. 

If you don't have toasted coconut and almonds on hand (I always have some in an airtight jar in the cupboard because they’re delicious on pretty much everything) then you can quickly cook some up while the quinoa is simmering. 

**Makes:** 4 servings

**Preparation time:** 15m  
**Cooking time:** 15m  
**Total time:** 45m

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 cup quinoa (rinsed and drained)
- 1/4 cup green lentils
- 1/4 cup toasted almonds (slivered or sliced)
- 1/4  cup toasted coconut (unsweetened shredded coconut)
- 1 - 2 cups cooked chicken (I like to use left-over roasted chicken)
- 1 - 2 large carrots (or a handful of small rainbow carrots)
- 1 apple
- 1 lemon (juiced)
- 1 - 2 tablespoons raisins
- 1 head romain lettuce (torn into bite-sized pieces)
- 2 cups water, stock or bone broth (divided - note: if making this gluten-free or nightshade-free make sure to check the ingredients on your stock)

**Equipment:** 2 saucepans, non-stick skillet, large bowl

---

**Instructions:**

1. Simmer 1/2 cup quinoa in 1 cup of liquid (water, stock or bone broth) for about 20 minutes or until the water is all absorbed. Fluff with a fork. 
1. In a separate saucepan simmer 1/4 cup green lentils in 1 cup of liquid (water, stock or bone broth) for about 30 minutes until they are softened through. Drain off the excess liquid. 
1. If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to toast the almonds and coconut.

First heat a non-stick skillet over medium-high, then put in a handful of sliced or slivered almonds. Frequently shake the pan and toss almonds into the air to keep from burning. Once it looks like they are pretty well toasted pour them into a heat proof bowl. Repeat with the coconut, and be careful, the coconut will cook/burn faster. 
1. Meanwhile chop or shred the chicken, carrots, and apple into bite-sized pieces. 
1. In a large bowl, toss together the quinoa, lentils, chicken, carrots, apple, and lemon juice. Chill until ready to serve. 
1. Just before serving mix in the raisins and lettuce then top with toasted almonds and coconut.
