Sweet potatoes are full of wonderful nutrients that you should have in your regular diet. They have tons of vitamin A and manganese. Plus they are a great source of vitamins C, E, K, B6, iron, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium! They even have some fiber and protein. If you are not eating enough sweet potatoes, maybe you should try drinking them.

There is one ingredient in this recipe that you may be unfamiliar with: coconut water powder. This powder is made by draining the liquid from a coconut and evaporating all of the water out of it. The solids left behind are what the powder is made of. Often glucose is used in the evaporation process to give the coconut water solids something to hold on to. This makes coconut water powder a little sweeter than the water straight from a coconut. If you would prefer less sugar in this smoothie you can do so in one of the following ways: 1. leave out the powder all together; 2. buy a coconut, crack it open, freeze the liquid in an ice cube tray; 3. buy bottled coconut water and freeze it into ice cubes. You could also replace the coconut water with unsweetened coconut milk for a similar flavor but thicker texture, but you will have to freeze the coconut milk in ice cubes the same way as if you were using fresh or bottled coconut water. Coconut water, liquid or powder, can be found in the drink section of most grocery stores.
