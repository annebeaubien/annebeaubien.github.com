I have made this recipe using a variety of different apples; some work great while others do not. Some have great texture and flavor after baking, while others turn to mush or loose all flavor. You want to make sure to use apples that can be cooked while retaining flavor and texture.

Do use one of these Apples: Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Honeycrisp. Mutsu, Pippin.
Do NOT use one of these Apples: Jonagold, Gala, Red Delicious
