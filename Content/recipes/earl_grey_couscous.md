The unfortunate bergamot orange is awkward looking, has inedible flesh and would have most likely have become extinct long ago if it were not for its saving grace; the fragrant rind. That’s where the sweet-scented oil is and it can be used for a variety of purposes. We know it as the key flavoring in Earl Grey tea, but it is also added to men’s and women’s fragrances. In this recipe I have paired that aromatic tea with juicy navel oranges for naturally complementary flavors in a salad of whole wheat couscous.

**Makes:** 6

**Preparation time:** 10m  
**Cooking time:** 10m  
**Total time:** 20m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 tablespoon Earl Grey tea (loose leaf will give you the better flavor, but cut open a tea bag it that’s all you have)
- 1 1/4 cups boiling water
- 1 cup instant whole-wheat couscous
- 2 naval oranges (Cara Cara if possible)
- 1  cup diced English cucumber (about 1/2 cucumber, no need to peel)
- 1/2 cup fresh mint (chopped)
- 1  cup sliced almonds
-  salt and pepper (to taste)

**Instructions:**

1. Put the Earl Grey tea in a medium-sized bowl, and pour the boiling water over it. Let tea steep for 5 minutes. No more, no less. 
1. Add the couscous and cover for 5 minutes. (Do not remove the tea leaves they are perfectly edible and eating the whole leaf provides more antioxidants).
1. Meanwhile supreme the oranges by cutting off the peel and all the the white pith. Then hold the orange with the dividing membranes running vertically. Using a thin knife cut along one side of the membrane, then cut along the other side. Continue to do this until the segments of orange are freed. Drop the membrane free segments into a bowl, then cut into bite-sized pieces and set aside. This process makes citrus fruit more attractive but is unecessary. You can just peel and cut the orange into bite sized pieces if you prefer.
1. In a dry skillet swirl the almond slices over medium heat until they are evenly browned. Shaking pan and stirring frequently to make sure they do not burn. Once browned remove from heat immediately and set aside.
1. Fluff the couscous with a fork, add the oranges, cucumbers and mint then season with salt to taste.
1. Stir in the almonds just before serving so they don't get soggy. 
1. This dish can be chilled before serving if desired. If so, wait to add the toasted almonds until serving, this will keep them nice and crisp.
