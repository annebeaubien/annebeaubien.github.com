description: Fårikål is a traditional Norwegian stew of lamb and cabbage that is commonly consumed throughout the year. In fact it is so well loved throughout the country that it is the first Norwegian recipe that my forlovede (fiancé) asked me to make for him.

Typically this dish is made with cabbage, mutton or lamb shoulder, salt, flour and whole black peppercorns. As usual I have made a few adjustments. I replaced the cabbage with Brussels sprouts; you can use either one I just love how cute the little sprouts are. My recipe also uses potato flour to thicken the broth instead of wheat flour. As long as you are not making this meal gluten-free then feel free to use regular flour, or leave out the flour all together if you are on the Paleo diet. Some people prefer to leave the flour out to create a thinner broth. I prefer the subtle flavor the potato flour gives to the sauce.

I find that a tagine works perfectly for this dish. If you don’t have one then you can use a slow cooker, dutch oven or a heavy bottomed saucepan with lid.

**Equipment:** tagine/slow cooker/dutch oven/heavy bottomed saucepan with lid

**Instructions:**

1. Clean and quarter the Brussels, making sure to leave some of the core attached to each piece. Divide the prepared Brussels into two roughly equal groups.
1. If not using flour, skip to step 3. Otherwise, place the flour in a medium sized bowl. Then take each piece of lamb and dip it into the flour to coat it on all sides. 
1. Alternating ingredients and working in layers, evenly distribute the lamb, 1/2 the Brussels sprouts, the peppercorns and the salt. 
1. Pour the water down one side of the saucepan so it goes strait to the bottom. 
1. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 hour. Keep the heat as low as you can to maintain the simmer.
1. Add the rest of the Brussels sprouts then cover and simmer until the lamb is tender enough to practically fall off the bone (30-60 minutes depending on the size of the pieces). Divide between 2 rimmed plates or bowls, making sure to get plenty of the broth in each bowl.
1. In Norway this dish would be served alongside boiled potatoes and carrots.
