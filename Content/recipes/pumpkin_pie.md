description: Here’s another pumpkin-y goodie coming at you.

As soon as fall begins, I love taking a trip to the pumpkin patch and buying tons of different kinds of pumpkins and squashes. I decorate the house with them and one by one I use them up cooking different dishes. Though since having 2 kids, I’m finding it harder and harder to find time to cook and having to take cooking shortcuts like pre-chopped veggies, and pre-peeled garlic. This is one of those recipes that can go either way. Use a freshly roasted pumpkin or use canned pumpkin to save time. You can also buy a pie crust or make your own. 

**Makes:** one 9" pie

**Preparation time:** 20m  
**Cooking time:** 20m  
**Total time:** 1h30m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups gluten-free graham crackers crumbs (about 9 graham cracker sheets)
- 6  tablespoons butter (softened)
- pinch  salt
- 15 ounces pumpkin puree
- 15 ounces butternut squash puree
- 13.5 ounces full-fat canned coconut milk
- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 4 organic eggs
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon ground allspice

**Equipment:** pie plate

**Instructions:**

1. If you’re roasting the pumpkins get them going first (about an hour at 400ºF) other wise you can make the crust first. Preheat oven to 325ºF/160ºC. 
1. Combine the crushed graham crackers with butter and a pinch of salt. Press it into a pie tin and bake for 10 min. 
1. In a blender or with a hand mixer combine the pumpkin, squash, coconut milk, sugar, eggs, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, ginger and vanilla extract.
1. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the crust and bake at 350ºF/175ºC for 1 hour or until the middle is set but still jiggly.
1. Remove from the oven and let it cool at least an hour before eating.
