This recipe is a slight variation to my Chocolate Pudding recipe from last year. The coconut flavor in this comes from coconut sugar, coconut milk and crispy toasted coconut on top. 

Coconut sugar can sometimes be pricey or hard to find. If you don't want to use it just use the same amount of regular sugar. 

**Makes:** 2 servings

**Preparation time:** 1m  
**Cooking time:** 1m  
**Total time:** 11m

---

**Ingredients:**

- 1/4 cup coconut sugar (or 4 dates, but you must have a powerful blender like a Vitamix otherwise it will end up lumpy)
- 1 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut milk
- 1/4  cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch (or potato starch)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon toasted coconut


---

**Equipment:** blender, saucepan 

---

**Instructions:**

1. Put the **coconut milk**, **coconut sugar**, **cocoa powder**, **cornstarch** and **vanilla extract** into a blender and blend on high until combined. 
1. Pour the mixture into a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches the desired thickness. Stir constantly to keep it from burning or getting lumpy. This will also allow you to see how thick it is. Remove it from the heat as soon as it is the thickness you want otherwise it will get lumpy. If you are using cold soy milk this may take up to 10 minutes, but will probably only take about 5. It will bubble up a bit and when the foam settles it thickens quickly so watch it closely.
1. Enjoy while it is hot or refrigerate and enjoy cold during the summer. If you plan to have it cold, just know that it will thicken up a bit more as it cools.
1. Top it with **toasted coconut** and enjoy alongside fresh berries. ([How to toast coconut)](https://wafflehearts.com/howtos/how_to_toast_coconut)


 Note: If you have a Vitamix you can just pour all of the ingredients into it, and blend on high for 5-6 minutes. No need to use a saucepan.
