1. Chop and wash leeks. Then add them to the saucepan. For detailed instructions on how to prepare leeks easily, see my post: INLINE-LINK-START title="How To: Chop and Wash Leeks" href="../../howtos/how-to-chop-and-wash-leeks" target="_blank">How To: Chop and Wash Leeks INLINE-LINK-END
1. Add the vegetable stock to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Then turn the heat down and simmer until the potatoes are tender (about 20 minutes). 
1. If you want this soup a bit chunky then remove some of the leeks and potatoes and set aside.  Place the rest of the soup into a blender and puree until smooth. Add the removed leeks and potatoes back in and reheat to desired temperature.
1. Garnish with freshly-ground black pepper and enjoy this hot, or cool and refrigerate for up to 3-4 days.
