These are a regular in our house because I just love the way these lentils taste! Look for organic corn tortillas that are low in calories. Whole foods sells their 365 brand that have less than 50 calories per tortilla and the only ingredients are corn, water and lime. Or better yet, ditch the tortilla and pile the rest of the ingredients on top of a cup of fresh spinach for a nutrient-rich taco salad. You can drizzle the greek yogurt and salsa on top like salad dressing.
