description: These biscuits make a great addition to any meal, and can made from scratch in 20 minutes!

There are two great features of these pillowy biscuits: 1. they are effortless to make, and 2. you can easily change the flavor to compliment the rest of your meal. Having chili for dinner? Add 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1 teaspoon paprika and 1 teaspoon dried oregano. Is stuffed pumpkin on the menu? Just add 1 teaspoon of dried sage and 1 tsp dried rosemary. How about tomato soup? Try mixing 1/4 cup cheddar cheese into the dough and sprinkle a little on top of each biscuit as they go into the oven. Feel free to play around with this recipe. If you use dry spices, try 1 teaspoon of each and add them with the dry ingredients before mixing in the Greek yogurt. If you are adding cheese, add it after the wet ingredients.

**Makes:** 12 biscuits

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 20m

**Ingredients:**

- 10 ounces whole-wheat pastry flour (this is about 2 packed, leveled cups)
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon fine salt
- 1 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup milk

**Equipment:** baking sheet, parchment paper

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
1. In a large bowl, combine the **whole-wheat pastry flour**, **baking powder** and **salt**. Stir together with a fork, then add the **yogurt** and **milk**. Continue to stir to form the dough. It should be quite thick. Feel free to use your hands to kneed the dough until all of the dry flour is incorporated. Be careful not to over mix.
1. Using two table spoons you are going to drop the biscuits onto a baking sheet leaving about 1” between them. Use the first spoon to scoop up some of the dough (about the size of a golf ball), then use the second spoon to scrape the dough onto the baking sheet. Continue until you have used up all of the dough. You should end up with 12 biscuits.
1. Bake for 15 minutes until golden brown.
1. These are best when eaten right away but can be stored for a few days in the refrigerator. I recommend popping a couple in the oven for a few minutes to reheat them before eating.
