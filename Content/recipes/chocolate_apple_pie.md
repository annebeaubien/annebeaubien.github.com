Chocolate Apple Pie...sounds weird right? You can always leave out the apples and have a super rich chocolate pie instead, but I’ve been told the apples are quite good in it. One person even said that was his favorite part.

This recipe makes 2 miniature (5”diameter) pies. If you want to make 1 full sized pie instead, just double the recipe. 

**Makes:** 2 servings

**Preparation time:** 10m  
**Cooking time:** 10m  
**Total time:** 10m

**Ingredients:**

- 2 tablespoons nuts (almonds, cashews, walnuts, macadamia or a combination of these)
- 2 tablespoons rolled oats (gluten-free if desired)
- 14  pitted dates
- 2/3 cup chopped apple (1 small apple)
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 6  tablespoons unsweetened milk substitute (unsweetened coconut, soy, almond, etc.)
- 1 avocado (cut open and discard the pit)

**Equipment:** mini pie tins (5” diameter),  blender

---

**Instructions:**

1. Put the nuts, oats and 8 dates into a blender and puree. This will be the crust, so you want it to have a doughy consistency. Remove the “dough” and put it into two 5” diameter pie tins. Press it into the pie tins the same way you would a pie crust, so that it covers the bottom evenly and comes up the sides. 
1. Dice the apple and place 1/3 cup into each prepared pie crust.
1. Put the rest of the dates into the blender along with the cocoa powder and milk substitute. Then using a spoon, scoop the avocado flesh into the blender.
1. Puree on high until smooth. You can add a little more liquid if you think it needs it. Just add 1 teaspoon at a time. 
1. Scoop the Chocolate pudding out of the blender and spoon it on top of the apple slices. 
1. Eat right away or refrigerate for a few hours before devouring. If you can wait that long.
