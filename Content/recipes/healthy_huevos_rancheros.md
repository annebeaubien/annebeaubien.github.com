description: Spice up breakfast for under 400 calories! Check out this healthy version of a Mexican classic.
---
You are probably wondering what is healthy about my huevos rancheros. Or perhaps you are wondering what’s not healthy about the original dish. There are several ways to make this Mexican classic, but mine has under 400 calories. It is loaded with fresh greens, nutrient-rich black beans and the fats are healthy fats from avocados, not oils and cheese. 

When buying corn tortillas make sure to get organic tortillas with only two ingredients: corn and water. Sometime they add a little lime juice, that is fine. Just make sure you stay away from any tortillas made with butter or oil, these have double the calories. 

If you like eggs more than avocado you can swap out the avocado and add an extra egg and tortilla to keep it under 400 calories. Or if you use 1/4 of an avocado, 2 eggs and 2 tortillas you are at about 410 calories
