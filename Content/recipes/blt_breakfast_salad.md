Who says you can’t have salad for breakfast? Nobody ever does! The French have croissants and coffee, the Italians have brioche and cappuccinos, the English eat eggs fried in oil with beans and toast, and do not get me started on the Americans! Typical American breakfasts consist of heavy dishes loaded with fat, sugar and empty calories. Even healthy American breakfasts like oatmeal or yogurt are often laden with sugar. Where are the greens? Why not start your day out right by making healthy eating choices from the start.

**Equipment:**

**Instructions:**

1. Put the lettuce into a large bowl
1. Top with sliced tomato, avocado and crumbled bacon.
1. Gently lay the egg on top. I like to have a soft yolk so that when it breaks it runs all over the lettuce like dressing. 
1. Grab a fork and dig in.
