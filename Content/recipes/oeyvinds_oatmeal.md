description: We recently had some friends visiting from Norway and they introduced us to a way that Norwegians commonly eat oatmeal. It is quite different from the sweet, warm dish that Americans traditionally think of as oatmeal.

I was standing in the kitchen with my fiancé's best friend, Øyvind, when he asked if he could have a bowl of cereal. I said, “I don’t mind, but unfortunately we are out of cereal”. Looking skeptically at me he reached up and grabbed the container of oatmeal and said, “Sure you do, it’s right here”. He proceeded to mix dry rolled oats, nuts, seeds and dried fruit in a bowl. Then he poured milk on top and began to eat it. I asked if he wanted it cooked and he just looked at me quizzically as if silently questioning why I would ever cook oatmeal. I realized that this is the perfect way to enjoy nutritious, wholesome oatmeal during those warm summer months when you do not want something hot for breakfast. Not to mention the mixture of nuts, seeds and dried fruit is much healthier than all of the processed oils and sugars in regular cereals.
