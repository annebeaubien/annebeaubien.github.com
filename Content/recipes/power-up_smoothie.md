With this recipe you can use either fresh or frozen fruit, wheatgrass and spinach. That way you can make it year round, even if the fruit is not currently in season. Using frozen ingredients will produce a thicker drink, while using fresh will be more watery. If using fresh ingredients you can add less milk to make the smoothie thicker if desired. If you are new to green smoothies and this isn’t sweet enough for you, try adding 1/2 a banana or a couple more strawberries. The strawberries are great at masking that distinctive wheatgrass flavor that takes a little getting used to. (For instructions on how to make wheatgrass juice see link at the bottom).
