description: Did you know that shepherds pie was created as a way to use up leftovers from Sunday roast* (an English tradition that continues today in pubs across the UK). Traditionally ground lamb or mutton was used, but you can replace it with ground beef, turkey, pork or chicken.

This recipe is really wordy but it is actually really easy. You can make the mix up ahead and keep it in the fridge until you need it, and you can use leftovers to make it. I have written it as if you are starting from scratch but feel free to replace whatever you want with leftovers that you already have. 

**Makes:** 2 servings

**Preparation time:** 50m  
**Cooking time:** 50m  
**Total time:** 1h30m

**Ingredients:**

- 4-8  tablespoons unsweetened organic soy milk
- 1 pound russet potatoes
- 1/2 cup diced onion
- 1 garlic clove (diced)
- 1/4 pound ground lamb
- 1/2  cup peas
- 1/2  cup diced carrots
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon celery seed
- 1/4  teaspoon celery flake
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic granules
- 1/4  teaspoon dried rosemary
- 1/4 cup dry green lentils (or 1/2 cup cooked)
- 1/4  teaspoon coarse salt (e.g. kosher salt)
- 1/2  cup low-sodium vegetable stock

**Equipment:** 10 oz ramekins (one per person), piping bag and medium sized tip (recommended), potato masher (recommended)

---

**Instructions:**

1. Wash, peel and chop the potatoes into roughly equal sized pieces, about an inch large. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Turn on the burner to high and bring to a boil then reduce to simmer for about 30 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, if you haven’t cooked the lentils yet you can do that while the potatoes are cooking. Place the lentils in a saucepan with water in the ration of 1 part lentils to 3 parts water, simmer for 25 minutes. (For more detailed instructions see my post onINLINE-LINK-START href="../../../howtos/how-to-cook-lentils" target="_blank"> How To: Cook Lentils INLINE-LINK-END)
1. While the potatoes and lentils are cooking you can sauté the onions and garlic and brown the lamb. To do this spray a skillet with non-stick spray and heat over medium-high. When the skillet is hot add the onions and garlic and sauté until they are translucent. Then add the ground lamb and break it up using a spatula. Once the meat is cooked through pour the onion, garlic and lamb into a large bowl. 
1. Preheat the oven to 400ºF/200ºC
1. Check on the mashed potatoes and lentils. Once they are cooked put the mashed potatoes in a separate medium-sized bowl and mash them with a potato masher. Once you have worked out all the lumps then measure out the amount of mash you have. You will need at least 1/2 cup for each ramekin. Add 2 tablespoons of soy milk for each 1/2 cup of mash, and salt to taste. Then place the potatoes into piping bags affixed with a medium sized piping tip (if using). I recommend the Wilton size 21, 22, or 199. Set aside.
1. Once the lentils are cooked through drain off any excess water and pour the lentils into the large bowl with the onion mixture.
1. Add the peas, carrots and all the spices to the large bowl and mix it well. Do not add the vegetable stock yet.
1. Spray 2 ramekins with non-stick spray and spoon the large bowl mixture evenly into each one. Now add 1/4 cup vegetable stock to each ramekin.
1. Take the mashed potatoes and either spoon them on top or pipe them onto the ramekins in a nice pattern moving up and down in short bursts. 
1. Place the ramekins into the upper part of the oven and bake for 10 minutes at  400ºF/200ºC. Then without removing the ramekins reduce the oven heat to 350ºF/175ºC and continue to bake for another 30 min. 
1. Remove from the oven and let them sit for 5 minutes before eating. Enjoy!
