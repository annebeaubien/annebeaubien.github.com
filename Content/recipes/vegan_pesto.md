When I first made this recipe I was sure I was going to have to replace the cheese with some other ingredient like nutritional yeast. However, I tried it and realized that by taking out the cheese you really taste the fresh basil! I found that I didnâ€™t miss the cheese at all. This sauce is great over your favorite pasta, gnocchi or steamed vegetables.

**Equipment:** blender

**Instructions:**

1. Place the **basil**, **lemon juice**, **olive oil** and **salt** into a blender and blend on high until smooth.
1. Add the pecans to the blender and blend until they reach desired consistency. Sometimes it's nice to have a smoother pesto and sometimes you want it chunkier.
1. Use as a pizza sauce, bread stick dipping sauce, or  over gnocchi and veggies in my recipe [Pestoed Veggies and Gnocchi](https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/pestoed_veggies_and_gnocchi/)
