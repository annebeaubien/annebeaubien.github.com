description: Sauces are easy to buy pre-made but I prefer to make my own to avoid icky fillers and preservatives. All you need is the right ingredients, a good blender and 5 minutes!

A good Pad Thai sauce is described as being sweet first, then spicy, salty and finally sour. The development of this flavor on your tongue is probably what has helped to make it one of Thailand's most popular dishes. Don’t worry if the sauce tastes too strong after it comes out of the blender, it will be diluted while cooking. 

This is just the recipe for the sauce. To make into a dish see my recipe for [Pad Thai](https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/pad_thai/)

- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice

**Equipment:** blender

**Instructions:**

1. Place all of the ingredients into a blender and blend on high until smooth. If you don't have a high powered blender you may end up with a chunkier sauce. Try letting the ingredients rest a bit so the solid parts can soak up some more liquid then blend again. You can also try adding a little water (1 tsp at a time) to help the blender along, the water will cook off when you use this to make [Pad Thai](https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/pad_thai/). 
1. Once you have made the sauce you can use right away or freeze. I like to make big batches and freeze them in 12oz mason jars.
