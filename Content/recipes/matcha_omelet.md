The key ingredient in this dish is Matcha, a powder made from ground up Sencha leaves. Sencha is a Japanese green tea. You can find Matcha at most tea shops as well as health focused grocery stores. I like to use hemp milk in this recipe because it gives it a nice sweet nuttiness. You can just as easily use soy, rice, almond, or regular milk.

**Instructions:**

1. Place the Matcha and soy milk in a bowl together and mix into a paste. 
1. Whisk the egg into the mixture.
1. Preheat a small skillet over medium heat and spray with non-stick spray.
1. Add the egg mixture to the skillet and cook over medium heat for a minute until the bottom starts to firm up.
1. At this point you can either add any regular omelet ingredients that you like (ie. ham, cheese, spinach, zucchini, tomatoes) or leave the omelet empty. 
1. Fold one side over the other using a spatula. Cook for 2-3 minutes more then remove from heat and serve warm.
