description: I don’t know about you, but regular mayonnaise freaks me out. Eating raw egg yolks? Gross!! Check out this vegan mayo that you can whip up in under 5 minutes with stuff you probably already have in your kitchen.

Most people who make their own mayonnaise will tell you not to use extra virgin olive oil because its flavor is too strong and will overpower the mayonnaise. This is true. Usually recipes recommend that you use canola oil, corn oil, or any number of other vegetable oils because they have less flavor. I kinda like the way olive oil tastes in mayonnaise. If it is too strong tasting for you then by all means use a different vegetable oil. Just make sure to get organic or non-GMO oil. Most oils on the market are genetically modified.

Tip: If you want a little more vinegary tasting mayonnaise, just replace 1 tablespoon soy milk with 1 tablespoon vinegar.

**Makes:** 1 cup

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 5m

**Ingredients:**

- 3 tablespoons unsweetened organic soy milk
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt (e.g. kosher salt)
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder
- 3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (or non-GMO canola oil/vegetable oil)

**Equipment:** immersion (stick) blender or regular blender

---

**Instructions:**

1. If using a stick blender: Place the soy milk, vinegar, lemon juice, dry mustard, salt, and olive oil into a tall cylindrical container in the order listed. Place the immersion blender all the way down to the bottom of the container and pulse on a low setting 10-20 times until the emulsion starts to come together and look like mayonnaise. Move the immersion blender around while pulsing to mix in any oil sitting on the top of the emulsion. 
1. If using a regular blender: Put in all the ingredients except the oil into the blender cup and mix together quickly. Then with the blender running slowly pour in the olive oil and let it mix until it looks like mayo. This should take about 60 seconds.
1. You should end up with a thick mayonaise. If your mayo is too watery just add a teaspoon more oil and blend again. Keep adding oil (one teaspoon at  a time) until you reach the desired thickness.
1. Refrigerate for up to a week. It is best if used in a 2-3 days.
