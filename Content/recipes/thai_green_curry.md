description: Recipes like this green curry are a great way to spice up your weekly dinners while using leftover meat and vegetables. You can make the paste ahead of time and refrigerate for up to a week, or buy a pre-made paste and whip this up in under half an hour.

The level of spiciness is this green curry depends on if you are making the paste yourself or buying it. One great thing about making your own is that you can tailor it to your own palate. (See my Green Curry Paste recipe to make your own). This is a great end-of-the-week recipe because it cooks quickly and you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand that did not get used up earlier in the week. I like to use eggplant (regular or Thai), zucchini, carrots, and a hearty lettuces like kale, spinach, collard greens, or chard. You can even toss in some shrimp, chicken or beans for added protein.
