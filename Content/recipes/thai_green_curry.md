description: Recipes like this green curry are a great way to spice up your weekly dinners while using leftover meat and vegetables. You can make the paste ahead of time and refrigerate for up to a week, or buy a pre-made paste and whip this up in under half an hour.

The level of spiciness is this green curry depends on if you are making the paste yourself or buying it. One great thing about making your own is that you can tailor it to your own palate. (See my Green Curry Paste recipe to make your own). This is a great end-of-the-week recipe because it cooks quickly and you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand that did not get used up earlier in the week. I like to use eggplant (regular or Thai), zucchini, carrots, and a hearty lettuces like kale, spinach, collard greens, or chard. You can even toss in some shrimp or chicken for a little added protein.

**Equipment:** 2 quart or larger saucepan

**Instructions:**

1. Heat a 2 quart saucepan over medium high heat.
1. In a small bowl stir theINLINE-LINK-START href="../../../recipes/green-curry-paste" target="_blank"> green curry paste INLINE-LINK-END into the coconut milk. Stir until it forms a smooth sauce. Then add it to the saucepan and bring to a simmer. 
1. Add the kaffir lime leaves and the 3 cups of chopped veggies to the saucepan. Stir all the veggies around until they are well coated in the sauce. Cover, turn the heat down to medium-low and let it simmer until the veggies reach desired tenderness. Depending on what veggies you use this could be 10-20 minutes. 
1. Keep an eye on the sauce while it's cooking. Check it every 5 minutes. If there isn't enough sauce just add some water. If the sauce is too thin then remove the lid and continue to cook uncovered.  Turn the heat up to and reduce the sauce for 5-10 minutes until it is the desired thickness. About a minute before it is done you’ll want to toss in the chopped chard, so that it can soften up a little. If you like your greens really soft you can put it in with the veggies, but I like to have a little crunch in it. 
1. Serve with warm brown rice.


Note: You can make up to 4 servings with the same amount of paste, just increase the veggies and greens.
