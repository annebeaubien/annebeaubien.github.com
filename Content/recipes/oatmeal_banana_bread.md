description: A cross between oatmeal cookies and banana bread, this sweet batter can be made into many shapes and they all taste great. My favorite is the good-old fashioned loaf, what’s yours?

Recently I found myself wondering why banana bread is made with added sugar when ripe bananas are so sweet. I decided to try making it without sugar and guess what? It turned out great! It didn’t need the refined sugar at all, just more bananas! I also was trying to find a way to add oatmeal to this bread when I came across a new discovery...oat flour!   

Whether you choose to make a banana bread loaf, muffins, mini-muffins or some other crazy shape it doesn’t matter, this recipe works for all of the above. 

*Note about oat flour* In the instructions I tell you how to make the oat flour using a blender and rolled oats. It is very easy to do and the best option if you are making this recipe gluten-free. Alternatively you can buy oat flour as is, but it is difficult to find gluten-free oat flour. Oats and oat flour is naturally gluten-free but it is usually processed on the same machines as grains that contain gluten so there can be cross contamination unless you buy oats that are sold as “gluten-free”. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers gluten-free oats. Also, this recipe measures the oats by weight, but if you don't have a kitchen scale you can use volume, but it won't be as accurate. 12 ounces of oat flour is about 3 cups.

**Ingredients:**

- 6 ripe bananas (medium - large)
- 2 organic eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon almond extract
- 12 ounces rolled oats (or oat flour - if making this recipe gluten-free make sure to get gluten-free rolled oats)
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
- 1/4  teaspoon fine salt
- 1/2 cup plain applesauce  (or softened butter if you’re feeling naughty - just know that this swap adds 800 calories and 90 grams of fat)
- 1 cup chopped walnuts/almonds/raisins (optional)

**Equipment:** large bowl, medium bowl, blender, scale, baking vessel of your choice 

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 350ºF/177ºC and prepare your baking vessel (e.g. loaf pan, muffin cups)
1. In a large bowl mash the bananas with a fork until all the chunks are gone. You can either use a fork or a potato masher. Then mix in the applesauce, eggs, vanilla and almond extracts. Set aside.
1. If using rolled oats, place them into a blender and puree until all of the oats are completely chopped up and resemble flour. Now you have oat flour. Depending on your blender you may want to only blend 4 ounces at a time. 
1. Place the oat flour into a medium-sized bowl. Then add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and sift these dry ingredients together.
1. Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until it is all incorporated.
1. Fold in the chopped nuts and/or raisins if using.
1. Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan, muffin cups or mini-muffin cups. 
1. Bake at 350 until a toothpick inserted in comes out clean. This should be about 45-50 minutes for a loaf, 27-32 minutes as muffins, or 18-20 minutes as mini muffins. 
1.
