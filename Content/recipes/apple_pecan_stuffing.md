description: Seasonal herbs, apples and pecans come together to make a sweet and nutty holiday stuffing that is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. This stuffing is so good you will want to have it year round. Who’s up for Christmas in July?

I have spent many years auditioning different stuffing recipes with the hope of finding one that will become a family favorite. Unfortunately certain members of my family (not to be named) refuse to eat key ingredients in the stuffing that I grew up with and love (my mom’s recipe) which is why I have this dilemma. Finally, after piecing together bits of my mom’s stuffing with several others we have tried over the years this dish has finally emerged. The apples give it a great tart/sweet flavor while the pecans add an irresistible nutty crunch. I have made it for two years in a row now with not a single complaint, and in fact many compliments, so I feel it is finally ready to share.

Stuffing in name only this recipe is actually baked in a medium-sized baking dish in the oven…not in a turkey. You can of course put it in your turkey if you wish but it will add cooking time to the turkey. 

**Makes:** 8 servings

**Preparation time:** 30m  
**Cooking time:** 30m  
**Total time:** 1h20m

- 2 eggs

**Equipment:** saucepan, large bowl, small bowl, 9x9 baking dish

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 300ºF/150ºC.
1. Slice the bread into 1” slices. Then spread out the slices into a single later in the oven and cook until the bread is dried out. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Carefully remove the bread from the oven and let it cool. Then cut or tear the bread into bite-sized pieces and place them into a large mixing bowl. Turn the oven temperature up to 375ºF/150ºC.
1. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Then add the celery, shallots, sage, marjoram, thyme, salt and pepper and sauté for 3-5 minutes until the shallots soften. Remove the mixture from the pan and pour it onto the bread pieces.
1. Chop the apples into 1/2-inch cubes.
1. Heat the saucepan over medium heat again and melt the last tablespoon of butter. As soon as it is melted add the cubed apples and sauté them for 3-5 minutes until they soften. Add the cooked apples to the bread mixture.
1. In a separate bowl whisk the eggs, then add the parsley. Pour this over the bread mixture. Add the pecans and toss everything together.
1. Drizzle about 1 cup of turkey (or vegetable) stock over the stuffing mixture then toss again. You want it to be soggy but not have a lot of excess liquid. Continue adding stock until you achieve this moisture level.
1. Place the stuffing into a baking dish, cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the cover and bake another 20 minutes to crisp up the edges of the bread. 
1. Garnish with a bit of chopped parsley and serve warm.
