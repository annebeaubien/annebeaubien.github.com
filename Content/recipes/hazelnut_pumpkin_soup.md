description: Hazelnuts, sage and cranberry make this rich pumpkin soup a perfect winter appetizer.

This rich soup is best served in small batches. Which makes it an excellent appetizer. 

For the pumpkin puree you can use canned pumpkin or make your own using either a kabocha squash or a golden nugget pumpkin. I think those are the best tasting. You cut the pumpkin in half, scoop out and discard the seeds, place both halves cut-side down in a roasting dish, pour 1/4 cup or so of water in the dish and roast until you can easily put a fork through the flesh. It can be roasted anywhere from 350-400ºF/ 175-200ºC for 30m - 90m depending in the size and temperature. Remove the pumpkin from the oven, scoop the flesh into a blender and puree until smooth.

**Equipment:** blender, saucepan

**Instructions:**

1. Put the pumpkin, 1 1/2 cups vegetable stock, sage and salt into the blender and blend on high until smooth. You can add more vegetable stock or water if you want the soup thinner. You can do this now or after the the other ingredients are added.
1. Add the cranberries and hazelnuts to the blender and process on a low setting just enough to chop the berries and nuts but not so high that they get completely pureed.
1. Pour the soup into a saucepan and heat to desired temperature. Adding more vegetable stock if needed. If you find you’ve added too much stock just boil it down to  the desired consistency. 
1. Just before serving garnish with a little chopped hazelnut and dried cranberries.
