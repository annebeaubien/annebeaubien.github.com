Shrimp scampi is a very easy dish to make. It is simply shrimp sautéed in olive oil and garlic then steamed in wine. I’ve added a few personal touches (like lots of green things) to make it a healthier meal. I also like to serve this on pasta or rice.

One thing to remember is that the dish takes on a lot of the characteristics of the wine that you use, so choose a wine you like to drink, then have a  glass with dinner. Dry wines like chardonnays or dry vermouth work best. You can make this dish using shrimp with tails on or off. Tails-off is certainly easier to eat, but keep in mind that leaving the tails on adds a lot of flavor to the sauce.

**Equipment:** skillet, large bowl

---

**Instructions:**

1. If serving this dish with pasta or rice you will want to have that started already.
1. Heat the **olive oil** in a skillet over medium heat.
1. Sauté the **garlic** and **oregano** over medium heat until the garlic starts to brown (3-5minutes).
1. Add the **shrimp**, then the **wine** and **capers**. 
1. Cook for 3-4 minutes on one side then flip them over halfway through cooking to make sure both sides are evenly done. 
1. Once the shrimp are cooked through, remove them from the heat and add the chopped **parsley**. 
1. Place the **greens** in a large bowl then tip the entire contents of the skillet onto the greens. You want to use hearty greens that will stand up to the heat. I prefer a mixture of baby spinach, baby kale and baby chard.
1. Toss the greens and shrimp together until well mixed then serve warm with pasta, rice, or crusty bread.
