Aptly named “Tom’s” after Tom the turkey, this is one of those recipes that came out of necessity but is now one of my favorites. I was out of bread so I couldn’t make a sandwich, but I was also out of salad dressing so I couldn't make a proper salad. Scouring the fridge in search of something to use as dressing I found the cottage cheese...what the heck? I decided to just start piling on ingredients that sounded good and then I remembered I had a ton of leftover cilantro and parsley so I threw that on too. Voilá.
