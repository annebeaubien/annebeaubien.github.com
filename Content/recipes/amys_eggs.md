description: A healthy and filling dish that takes only 5 minutes from start to finish. This is such a scrumptious breakfast that I have about once a week...pretty much whenever I am not eating oatmeal.

I never would have thought to put eggs and arugula in the same dish but they work so well together! This weekend I was hanging out with my friend Amy and she made this awesome egg concoction for breakfast. Now I cannot stop eating it! It is simple yet so satisfying. I like to use hemp milk in this recipe because it gives it a nice sweet nuttiness. You can just as easily use soy, rice, almond, or regular milk.


**Makes:** 1 serving

**Equipment:**

**Instructions:**

1. Spray a small skillet with non-stick spray and place over medium high heat.
1. In a small bowl whisk together the eggs and the hemp milk.
1. Pour the egg mixture into the hot skillet and use a spatula to scramble the eggs for about 2-3 minutes.Â 
1. Turn the eggs out onto a plate. I like to mix the arugula into the warm eggs so it wilts just a little then top with the sliced avocado.
1. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and eat it before it cools. Yum!
