One of the key ingredients in this recipe is cashew cream. If you haven’t made it before then I am very excited for you because you are going to love it! However, if you do not have a particularly powerful blender you’ll need to soak the nuts over night in order for them to be soft enough to puree, so plan ahead. (See “How To: Make Cashew Cream” link in the instructions section below).

You can use canned enchiladas sauce for this meal, but I recommend my home-made enchilada sauce. It’s easy to make in a blender and takes less than 5 minutes. (See “Enchilada Sauce” link in the instructions section below).

**Makes:** 1 serving (2 enchiladas)

**Preparation time:** 10m  
**Cooking time:** 10m  
**Total time:** 30m

**Ingredients:**

- 2 corn tortillas
- 1 cup frozen kale
- 1/2 cup frozen corn
- 1/2  cup beans (I like black beans, use your favorite)
- 4 tablespoons cashew cream (link to recipe at the bottom)
- 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoon lime juice
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
-  salt and pepper (to taste)
- 1 cup enchilada sauce (link to recipe at the bottom)

**Equipment:** large mixing bowl, wide and shallow bowl, baking dish

**Instructions:**

1. Take the **tortillas** out of the fridge and let them come to room temperature while you are doing the other prep. 
1. Thaw the **kale** and **corn** in a large bowl filled with cold water, then drain them and squeeze out the excess water. This should only take a few minutes. Put the kale and corn back into the bowl.
1. Add the **beans** to the bowl and mix in 2 tablespoons of [cashew cream](https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/cashew-cream), all of the **nutritional yeast**, **lime juice** and **garlic powder**. Taste the mixture and add a little **salt** and **pepper** if desired.
1. Pour the [enchilada Sauce](https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/enchilada_sauce) into a wide, shallow bowl and dip the tortillas into the liquid so they are coated on all sides with sauce.
1. Fill each tortilla with half of the kale mixture, then roll and set into a baking dish with the seam-side down. Make sure to use a baking dish the correct size for the number of enchiladas you are making. A 5x7 dish is perfect for 2, while a 7x10 dish is best for 4-6.
1. Once the torillas are filled and tucked into the dish, pour enchilada sauce on top of them until they are covered. If there isn’t enough sauce just add a little water. 
1. Bake at 350ºF/180ºC for 20 minutes.
1. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Then drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons cashew cream across the top and garnish with fresh cilantro.
