If you hate washing dishes as much as I do, you’ll love this ramekin recipe. It is prepared, cooked and served all in the same dish so there’s no extra cleanup! The following recipe makes just one serving, so it’s easy to double or triple for more guests. Best of all, since each is made in their own ramekin its easy to customize several for different dietary needs.
