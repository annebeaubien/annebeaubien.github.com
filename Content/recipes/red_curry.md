The vegetables in this recipe are just suggestions of what you can use in a red curry. Feel free to substitute for whatever you have on hand. For the sauce recipe please see “Red Curry Sauce” (link at the bottom). If you planning to serve this dish with a grain (like rice, barley, farro) start that first. Next you should make the sauce. The veggies and other ingredients can be prepared while the sauce is simmering. This recipe is vegetarian but feel free to add some chicken or shrimp if you like. If you are making this recipe gluten-free make sure to use rice, not barley or farro/if making it paleo then skip the grains all together and enjoy it as-is.

Most of this dish can be made ahead and finished off in about 10 minutes. You can do this by making the sauce, then chop all the veggies and refrigerate the sauce and veggies separately until needed.
