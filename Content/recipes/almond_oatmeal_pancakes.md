description: Just because you are having pancakes is no excuse to top them with unhealthy butter, whipped cream or loads of maple syrup. These are really great topped with fresh blueberries, a little apple butter or apple sauce.

Like many of my other recipes this one is designed to serve 2, so make sure to double if you are making it for 4. I always say it is easier to double a recipe than to half it. If you do not have a griddle you can just use 2 skillets going side by side to make the cooking go faster. 

If you are not making this recipe vegan, feel free to add an egg to batter to help these stick together better while cooking.
