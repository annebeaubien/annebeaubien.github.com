We all have heard the wonders of oatmeal, how it is nutritious, filling, helps lower cholesterol and is good for your heart. But have you heard of the wonders of Chia seeds? To answer your first question, yes these are the same seeds that you used to grow “hair” on you Chia Pet in the 80‘s. These seeds are very small but packed full of nutrients; they are a good source of Omegas, Calcium, Phosphorus, Dietary Fiber and Manganese. They have a unique quality about them that allows them to absorb 9 times their weight in water which is stored in a gelatinous shell that is slowly digested by the body, making a great weight loss aid. You can find chia seeds both online and and health food stores. Pre-ground chia seeds (like the ones used in this recipe) are a little more expensive but I prefer the texture of the ground seeds to that of the whole seeds. You can use whichever you prefer.
