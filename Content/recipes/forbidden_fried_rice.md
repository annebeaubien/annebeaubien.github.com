description: This fried rice is made with antioxidant-rich forbidden rice, aka black rice. Are you getting enough antioxidants in your diet?

If you have not yet discovered the antioxidant benefits of forbidden rice here is your chance. Also known as black rice, this grain is touted to be high in antioxidants, magnesium, and phosphorus. It is also a good source of protein, fiber, manganese and complex carbohydrates. Some sources say it’s better for you than brown rice but only if you get the whole-grain variety. Look for “whole black rice” on the label.

Note: if using zucchini or yellow squash, make sure to buy organic to avoid GMOs. As always I recommend you buy everything organic :)

**Equipment:** dutch oven, or large skillet with a rim

**Instructions:**

1. If you haven’t cooked the rice yet do that first! It only takes about 30 minutes. You can start cooking the rest of the ingredients when the rice has been on for about 15 minutes. 
1. Heat the olive oil in a dutch oven or large skillet with a rim over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion and garlic for 3-5 minutes until translucent. 
1. Add the chopped veggies and sauté about 10 minutes until al dente, stirring occasionally.
1. Next mix in the ham, rice and pineapple.
1. Add the tamari, sesame oil and red pepper flakes (if using).
1. Crack the eggs into a small bowl. Season with a little salt and pepper. Add the milk substitute and whisk them up like you would scrambled eggs.
1. Pour the eggs over the top of the fried rice mixture
1. Turn the heat down to low and cover. Cook until the eggs are no longer runny, about 5 min.
1. Remove from heat, stir in the hearty greens, garnish with sesame seeds and serve.
