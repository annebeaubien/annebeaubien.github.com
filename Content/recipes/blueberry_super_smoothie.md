description: Topping the list of antioxidant rich foods is blueberries. They are full of flavonoids which help fight disease by ridding the body of free radicals. Additionally, this smoothie is full of manganese and potassium which are two minerals that are difficult to get enough of in food form. Did you know that you should have 5000mg of potassium per day?  A medium sized banana (the most potassium rich food) has only 400mg! Now I am not suggesting that you eat 12 bananas a day, but I do suggest you check out this smoothie and eat more fruits and veggies!

I try really hard to get all of my nutrients from food and green smoothies are a great way to do it. For less than 300 calories, this blueberry smoothie fills your daily requirements for vitamins A and K. It has 60% RDA of manganese, almost 50% RDA of folate, fiber and vitamin B12, and 25% RDA of potassium, calcium and magnesium. Whew! Now that is what I call a super smoothie!

*You probably noticed that I called this a green smoothie even though it is not green in color. Green smoothies have greens in them, like spinach, kale, chard or collards.
