I make this chili every year for our annual Halloween Chili and cornbread cook-off and it is always a big hit. It is not spicy, so kids like it as much as the grown-ups. If you want it to be low carb, just leave out the beans, it tastes just as good without them.

**Makes:** 12

**Preparation time:** 0m  
**Cooking time:** 20m  
**Total time:** 20m

**Ingredients:**

- 3 lbs ground beef or ground bison
- 2 tablespoons chili powder (not a mix - just ground chilies)
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 6 cups pureed tomatoes (this is 48 ounces)
- 1 bay leaf
- 3 cans pinto beans (optional)
- 3 cans black beans (optional)
- 1 32ounce container of vegetable broth (you may not need it all. I like
- Kettle & Fire organic vegetable broth)
- Salt and pepper (to taste)

**Equipment:** 
Dutch oven, stockpot or 6 quart slow cooker

---

**Instructions:**

1. Brown the beef over medium high heat. I like to sprinkle about a teaspoon of Malden sea salt on the beef right when I put it in the pan to cook. 
1. While the beef is cooking, sprinkle the chili powder and oregano over it and mix it in.
1. Once the beef is browned, turn the heat down to simmer and add tomatoes, bay leaf, pinto beans, and black beans. Stir and decide if you want to add any of the vegetable broth. I usually add about half of the container. The chili is ready to eat but will taste better the longer you let it simmer. You will also need to add more vegetable broth the longer you let it simmer.
1. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
1. Enjoy!
