description: This sauce is intended for use with pasta, ravioli or tortellini. I like to toss it with spaghetti and wilted spinach.

The first time I tried lemon and ricotta together was a few years ago in some local artisan's ravioli. The best way to eat those ravioli was with just a little olive oil and lemon zest. The flavor was incredible, creamy and salty with just a hint of lemony tartness. I havenâ€™t been able to find that ravioli lately so I decided to fake it by buying spinach ravioli and making this sauce. Basil adds just a little bit of sweetness to the sauce and with that you have three of the four basic tastes in one simple sauce! Yum!

**Instructions:**

1. Place all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix well. Use right away, do not make ahead.
1. Toss the sauce with the cooked pasta of your choice. I like to toss in some fresh spinach or parboiled veggies to make it a little healthier. The heat from the pasta will wilt the spinach just slightly. Serve warm.
