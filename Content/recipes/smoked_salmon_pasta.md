Who doesn’t get sick of eating out everyday while traveling? A few years ago I was staying in a hostel in Denmark and had this very problem. It had been about 2 weeks of eating out for every meal, and while the food had all been delicious sometimes you just want a homemade meal. We were lucky enough to have access to a small kitchen with one or two pans so we knew we could at least boil water for pasta. After stopping by a little corner shop, we whipped up this dish in no time at all. We ate some of it right away and put the rest in the fridge for later. It tasted just as good hot as it did cold the next day! 

You can use any kind of pasta for this recipe. If you don’t have a kitchen scale to weight out the pasta, you can use the following volume measures. These are for approximately 2 servings.
- Elbow macaroni or similar size - 1 cup
- Penne or similar size - 1.5 cups
- Egg noodles or similar size - 2.5 cups

**Makes:** 2 servings

**Preparation time:** 10m
