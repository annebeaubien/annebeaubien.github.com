description: It’s pomegranate season! What better way to enjoy those sweet little seeds than in a Christmas smoothie?
---
Just in time for Christmas, we have a pretty red and green smoothie. Well it’s only red and green if your blender isn’t very good. Otherwise you end up with a nice reddish-pink :) Feel free to add more spinach to this smoothie, I usually do. Just be warned that the more spinach you add the browner it gets. I like to keep it nice and red when having guests over, they tend to be more particular when it comes to drinking random brown drinks…
