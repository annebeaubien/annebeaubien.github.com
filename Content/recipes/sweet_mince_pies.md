description: In England, mincemeat pies are synonymous with Christmas and usually accompanied by cold weather, choir concerts and mulled wine. Luckily they have finally made their way across to the pond to America!

I still remember the first, life-changing time I ate a mince pie. It was Christmas of 2007 and I was living in southern England. I was at a Christmas choir concert with another American friend of mine and it was intermission. We wandered around and discovered that they were serving mulled wine and mincemeat pies. Yum! Now that I think of it, that was the first time I ever had mulled wine too. What a great introduction to this integral part of English culture. 

Traditionally mincemeat pies contain suet or some other form of animal fat but my recipe is completely vegetarian and even includes a reduced-calorie option. These pies can be made with or without a crust. For less calories use individual ramekins (about 4oz each) to replace the crust. If you want to use a crust you can use either puff pastry or pie dough. Mince pies are usually individually sized, so a muffin tin or mini-muffin tin both work well. Just grease the tins and press the puff pastry/pie dough into them. *If you are making this recipe gluten free, make sure to buy gluten free pie crust or skip the pie crust and use the ramekins.*If you are making this recipe vegan, make sure to buy vegan pie crust or skip the pie crust and use the ramekins

This mince mixture requires 2 cups of dried fruit. I like to use 3/4 cup raisins, 1/2 cup currants, 1/2 cup sultanas and 1/4 cup goji berries. Feel free to use whatever combination you want as long as it adds up to 2 cups.
