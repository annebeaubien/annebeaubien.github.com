This version of French onion soup is made without butter, flour, sugar, or beef stock. 

Contrary to popular opinion, the trick to making really good French onion soup is the wine that you cook into it (not the amount of butter and sugar). The soup will take on a lot of flavor from the wine so make sure to use a wine that you like to drink. You can use white or red, dry wines tend to work better. 

Notes:  
*Vegan:* If making this vegan, make sure to use vegan cheese and vegan bread.  
*Vegetarian:* If you are a strict vegetarian, make sure to buy vegetarian cheese that does not contain animal rennet. You want to find cheese that is made without rennet or with vegetable rennet sometimes called "enzymes".  
*Gluten-Free:* Make sure to buy gluten free bread often found in the frozen section.

**Equipment:** 10” or 12” heavy-bottomed skillet or cast iron pan with lid (I use my cast iron tagine for this), toaster or oven

---

**Instructions:**

1. Slice or dice the **onions**. 
1. Heat the **olive oil** in a heavy-bottomed skillet or cast iron pan over medium.
1. Caramelize the onions by cooking them covered for 20 minutes, then turn the heat up to medium-high and uncover for 20 minutes more. Once uncovered, the onions need to be stirred every 3-5 minutes to keep from burning. They are done when they are dark brown. If your onions haven't started to darken yet, make sure you turned up the heat and cook a little while longer. They'll start to stick to the bottom of the pan. That's ok, just scrape this up and continue to stir ever 3-5 minutes.
1. Add the **wine** to the onions and cook for about 5 minutes at medium high.
1. Reduce the heat to low and add the **vegetable stock**, **bay leaf**, **sage** and **thyme** to the onions. Simmer for 30 minutes. If you want the soup to thicken up leave the lid off, otherwise cover it as soon as it reaches the thickeness you like. 
1. While the soup is cooking you can toast the **bread** into croutons. Preheat your toaster oven or oven to 400ºF and cook for 5-10 minutes until crunchy.
1. When the soup is finished cooking, taste it and season with **salt and pepper**. Remove the bay leaf and spoon the soup into individual ramekins. 
1. Top with croutons, then a thin layer of **cheese** and put under the broiler for 1-2 minutes until the cheese is bubbly. Take it out of the oven and enjoy it with a nice glass of that wine you used in it!
