Wheatgrass is the young grass stage of wheat, but contains no gluten. You can buy it at some health foods stores in the produce department as a living plant, or juiced and frozen into cubes in the freezer section. I prefer to grow my own. It is very easy to grow and the cheapest option. For more info on how to grow your own wheatgrass see my post “Growing Wheatgrass at Home” (see link at bottom of this page).

Most people juice wheatgrass, which you can do if you have a juicer. I do not, so I put mine into the blender. If you are only using a small amount of wheatgrass in a beverage, you do not need to strain it, but if there is a lot of wheatgrass you will probably want to. This recipe uses a lot of wheatgrass as well as apple which makes the drink very pulpy so I recommend straining it. 

I recommend using a high powered blender or juicer, the wheatgrass can clog regular blenders and juicers. I use a Vitamix blender and have never had a problem with it clogging.
