description: Norwegians have an unusually strong relationship with their potato salad. Recipes are strictly guarded by gas station attendants, grandmothers and potato farmers, kept locked in secret closets and never given to outsiders (even fiancés). Unfortunately for them, I am an expert at tasting recipes and recreating them.

Despite the fact that the average Norwegian eats potato salad quite regularly (at least once a week, sometimes everyday) I have never found a potetsalat recipe in any of the Norsk cookbooks I have come across. The primary use for potato salad is as a topping on hot dogs or as a spread on open-faced sandwiches. 

*A note about sour cream
Normally I would replace the sour cream with fat free greek yogurt, but Norwegians REALLY like their sour cream (at least mine does) and this would be an unacceptable substitution.


**Makes:** 2 servings

**Preparation time:** 30m

**Total time:** 50m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 pound potatoes
- 3/4 cup low-fat sour cream (8oz)
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill  (chopped)
- 1  tablespoon fresh chives (chopped)
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
-  salt and pepper (to taste)

**Instructions:**

1. Chop the potatoes into 2” pieces and place them in saucepan. Cover with water and heat over high until boiling. Turn the heat down to medium and continue to boil for about 20 minutes or until you can stick a fork in one and it breaks apart. 
1. Remove the potatoes from the heat and drain off the excess water. 
1. Stir in the sour cream, dill, chives and vinegar.
1. Continue to stir until it resembles really lumpy mashed potatoes. Norwegian potato salad is usually used as a spread and not as a side dish, so you want it smooth enough to spread on bread, but not as smooth as mashed potatoes. 
1. Serve hot or chilled in place of mayonnaise on a sandwich or top your hotdog with potetsalat and crispy fried onions.
