Recently I ate at one of Dr. Weil’s True Food Kitchens and discovered horseradish vinaigrette. (If you have not heard of the True Food Kitchen or Dr. Weil google them now! The restaurants focus on using healthy, often organic, seasonal ingredients, environmental awareness, and support following an anti-inflammatory diet.) They served the vinaigrette over roasted winter veggies and it was amazing. So I came home and tried to create something similar. Try it over roasted veggies, as a salad dressing or even as a sauce for meat!

About the ingredients:
- Prepared horseradish comes in a jar that can be found in the refrigerated section of your local grocery store.
- Mustard powder can be found in the baking aisle with the spices. Not only does it add flavor to the vinaigrette but it helps the olive oil and vinegar keep from separating. If you do not want to use the powder you can use prepared mustard.


**Makes:** 1 cup  

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 5m

**Ingredients:**

- 1/4  cup apple cider vinegar
- 4 tablespoons prepared horseradish
- 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard powder (or 1 tsp prepared mustard)
- 1/2  teaspoon garlic granules
- 1 teaspoon dried dill
- 3/4  cup extra virgin olive oil
-  salt and pepper ( to taste)

**Equipment:** blender or whisk

**Instructions:**

1. Combine the vinegar, horseradish, dry mustard powder, garlic powder and dill and whisk/blend until well combined. 
1. Continue whisking while adding the olive oil. Slowly drizzle in 1/4 cup at a time. This will help the olive oil to suspend and stay combined longer. If you let it sit for a long time it will separate. Taste it then season with salt and pepper. 
1. Use right away or refrigerate and use within a week. If you refrigerate it you will need to take it out and let it come to room temp (about 30 min) because the olive oil solidifies and may separate. Just give it a quick whisk before using.
