I have made this quiche in several different forms: in a large baking dish, individual ramekins, and even in muffin and mini-muffin tins! Make the mixture up first, then pour it into your favorite baking container. It makes a great addition to breakfast or brunch. You can even serve it up for lunch or dinner alongside a salad.
