description: This paste is the basis for making a moderately spicy green curry. It is super easy to whip up in a blender and tastes much better than store bought. It will last 2 weeks if refrigerated. See my Thai Green Curry recipe for how to use this paste.

I bought a jar of green curry paste from the store and after looking at the ingredients realized that it was not vegetarian. I decided to look online to try to find a vegetarian green curry paste recipe but every thing I found had fish oil and shrimp paste in it. So here is my vegetarian version of green curry paste.

Most green curry recipes call for 4 Thai chiles. This recipe only uses two. You can easily add more or take them out all together depending on your desired spiciness.

A quick note about umeboshi paste. It is made from pickled Japanese plums (ume) that are pureed. They give a salty/sweet taste to the dish and are an excellent replacement of the fish oil and shrimp paste. A container of umeboshi paste is usually 7oz and can be used to make this recipe 3 times with a little left over. Since it is picked it keeps for a few months in the fridge, some even say it can keep for years. It is available at Whole Foods Market and some Asian markets.

**Makes:** 1 cup of paste (2-4 servings)

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m

1. Cut the root and greenery off the lemon grass, and peel off the outer layer. You should end up with a 3 inch long piece. Slice it into 1/4inch rings and place into the blender.
