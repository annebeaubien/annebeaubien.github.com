description: Tea is a great morning pick-me-up. It gives you a calm, focussed energy as opposed to the jitteriness and crash that often accompany coffee. This smoothie combines chai tea with spinach, banana and rice milk to make a low calorie drink that is high on nutrients and low on the twitch scale.

To make this smoothie I like to brew fresh chai tea, then chill it for a few hours in the fridge. My favorite chai tea comes from www.samovarlife.com. If you do not normally keep bananas in your freezer you will want to for this smoothie. Just cut one up into about 5 pieces and freeze for 4 hours. You can freeze the banana while the tea is cooling. Better yet, do both the night before and make this as a breakfast smoothie.
