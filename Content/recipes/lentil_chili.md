This is one of those recipes that I really do not mind having to test over and over again because it’s so healthy and delicious. I have had it twice this week and I’m planning on making it again this weekend :) It also makes a great dish to serve when you are having guests over because it meets nearly every dietary restriction: Dairy-free, Gluten-free, Vegetarian, Vegan, safe for both diabetics and those following and Engine 2 diet. You can always serve it with mix-ins on the side, like Greek yogurt and grated cheese, for those not following a special diet.

This recipe makes a mild chili, and I find that mild is better for a crowd, however you if you want it spicy just add an extra teaspoon of cayenne pepper, or use a spicy chili powder (I usually use mild chili powder). I recommend making it a little milder the first time until you figure out how much spice is enough for you. Just remember, you can easily make this stew spicier just before serving by sprinkling in a little cayenne. It is much more difficult to take that spice away. If you want this chili to be mild make sure to use mild chili powder, sweet paprika (not hot) and omit the cayenne.

You can make this in the slow-cooker or on the stove top. You just need to cook it long enough for the lentils to soften. Here are some quick cooking times:
Stove top at simmer: 40 min
Slow-cooker on high: 3.5 hours
Slow-cooker on low: 6-8 hours
