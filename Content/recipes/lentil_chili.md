description: It’s finally fall! In my house that means it is the beginning of slow-cooker season! This vegetarian chili can be made in a slow-cooker or more quickly on the stove top.

This is one of those recipes that I really do not mind having to test over and over again because it’s so healthy and delicious. I have had it twice this week and I’m planning on making it again this weekend :) It also makes a great dish to serve when you are having guests over because it meets nearly every dietary restriction: Dairy-free, Gluten-free, Vegetarian, and Vegan. You can always serve it with mix-ins on the side, like Greek yogurt and grated cheese, for those not following a special diet.

This recipe makes a mild chili, and I find that mild is better for a crowd, however you if you want it spicy just add an extra teaspoon of cayenne pepper, or use a spicy chili powder (I usually use mild chili powder).

You can make this in the slow-cooker or on the stove top. You just need to cook it long enough for the lentils to soften. Here are some quick cooking times:
Stove top at simmer: 40 min
Slow-cooker on high: 3.5 hours
Slow-cooker on low: 6-8 hours

**Makes:** 6 servings

**Preparation time:** 15m  
**Cooking time:** 15m  
**Total time:** 55m
