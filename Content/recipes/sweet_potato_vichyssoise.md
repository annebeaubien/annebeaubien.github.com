Many chefs have tried to lay claim to this popular recipe and while the origin has been greatly debated, the recipe itself is not. Vichyssoise is traditionally a cold soup made of potatoes, leeks, cream and garnished with fresh chives. In this recipe I replace the potato with sweet potato and substitute fat-free Greek yogurt for a creamy low-calorie soup that is the perfect summer appetizer.

Most people will have 2-3 cups of soup for a main course and 1 cup for an appetizer. 


**Makes:** 6-7 cups

**Preparation time:** 2h10m  
**Cooking time:** 2h10m  
**Total time:** 2h30m

**Ingredients:**

- 2 leeks (sliced)
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable stock
- 1 cup fat-free Greek yogurt
-  fresh chives (for garnish)
- 1 pound sweet potatoes (roughly 1 large or 2 small)

**Equipment:** blender, 2.5 quart (or larger) saucepan

**Instructions:**

1. Peel the sweet potato, then dice into bite-sized pieces. Place the pieces into a 2.5 quart (or larger) saucepan and set aside.
1. Chop and wash leeks. Then add them to the saucepan. For detailed instructions on how to prepare leeks easily, see my post: INLINE-LINK-START title="How To Chop and Wash Leeks" href="../../howtos/how-to-chop-and-wash-leeks" target="_blank">How To: Chop and Wash Leeks INLINE-LINK-END
1. Add the vegetable stock to the saucepan and bring to a boil. Then turn the heat down and simmer until the potatoes are tender (about 20 minutes). 
1. Place all of the soup into a blender along with the Greek yogurt. Puree until smooth. 
1. Refrigerate until cold (about 2-3 hours) then serve garnished with chopped chives.
