description: Do you have kids that want to help in the kitchen? This is a great recipe for them. My 3 year old and I make these cookies all the time and I don’t feel even a little bit guilty letting him have them.

My toddler and I enjoy making these cookies together often. He mashes the banana, scoops the oats, and cracks the eggs, but I think his favorite part is taste-testing the raisins and pecans before we put them in. He even enjoys spooning them onto the baking sheet and setting a timer to check on them. My favorite part is not feeling even a little bit guilty about letting him eat these for breakfast as we’re running out the door. 


**Makes:** 12 cookies

**Preparation time:** 10m  
**Cooking time:** 10m  
**Total time:** 30m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 ripe banana

- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 2 organic eggs
- 1/2 -1 cup raisins (and/or chocolate chips/nuts)

**Equipment:** baking sheet, large bowl

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 350ºF/180ºC. Prepare your baking sheet. (I like to use silicone baking mats).
1. Mash the banana, then mix in the oats, egg and peanut butter. 
1. Once the mixtures looks fairly homogenous, stir in the raisins/chocolate chips/nuts. 
1. Spoon onto a baking sheet and cook in the oven for about 20 minutes. This depends on how big you made them. If you got 12 cookies then 20 minutes should be perfect. 
1. Enjoy!
