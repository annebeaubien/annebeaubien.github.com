description: Fårikål is a traditional Norwegian stew of lamb and cabbage that is commonly consumed throughout the year. In fact it is so well loved throughout the country that it is the first Norwegian recipe that my forlovede (fiancé) asked me to make for him.

Typically this dish is made with cabbage, mutton or lamb shoulder, salt, flour and whole black peppercorns. As usual I have made a few adjustments. I replaced the tougher meat with lamb rib chops, and I removed the flour. 

I find that a tagine works perfectly for this dish. If you don’t have one then you can use a slow cooker, dutch oven or a heavy bottomed saucepan with lid.

**Instructions:**

1. Clean and slice the cabbage into wedges, ideally leaving a small piece of the core attached to each section.  
1. Place the larger peices of lamb at the bottom of your pan, then a layer of cabbage, peppercorns and salt. Repeat until you run out of ingredients. . 
1. Pour the vegetable stock down one side of the saucepan so it goes strait to the bottom. 
1. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer. Keep the heat as low as you can to maintain the simmer. Temperature guage after 1 hour, but this might need to cook for up to 2 hours. You are looking for an internal temperature between 135-155ºF. 
1. While the lamb is cooking you can boil the potatoes. Wash and place them into a pan with cold water. Then bring to a boil. They will take at least 30 minutes. They are done when you can stick a fork all the way into them. 
1. Enjoy!
