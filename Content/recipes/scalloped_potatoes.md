description: Normally scalloped potatoes are slathered with butter and cheese while drowning in a sea of cream until there’s not much potato left to speak of.  While undeniably delicious this is not a particularly healthy dish. My scalloped potato recipe is simply potatoes, garlic and vegetable stock. If that wasn’t healthy enough, I even slipped in a little broccoli.

While this dish resembles a gratin, it technically is not. Gratins are topped with butter and either cheese or breadcrumbs then baked until crispy. I removed the cheese, breadcrumbs and butter and made a healthier version of the traditional potatoes gratiné. I also slipped some broccoli into these but feel free to add other veggies like carrots or cauliflower. 


**Makes:** 2 servings

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 pound potatoes (Yukon gold or red-skinned)
- 1/2  cup broccoli (chopped)
- 3 garlic cloves (minced or crushed)
- 1/2  cup low-sodium vegetable stock
-  salt and pepper (to taste)

**Equipment:** vegetable peeler, small baking dish (holds about 2 cups)

---

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF/218ºC and spray a small baking dish with non-stick spray.
1. Wash the potatoes (you can peel them if you wish but I prefer not to). Then use a vegetable peeler to slice the potatoes into thin pieces. You can also use the slicer side of a box grater. Continue until you have sliced all of the potatoes. Pile them into the greased baking dish and spread them out evenly.
1. Mix the broccoli and garlic into the potatoes and lightly season with salt and pepper. 
1. Pour the vegetable stock on top.
1. Cover and bake at 425ºF/218ºC for 20 minutes. Then uncover and bake another 20 minutes. The potatoes are done when they are soft and most of the liquid is absorbed. Let cool 5-10 minutes before serving.
