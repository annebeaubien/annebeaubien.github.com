We often have left-over rotisserie chicken in our fridge and are always looking for different ways of using it up. This is also a great way to enjoy left-over turkey from Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner.

For the flaky sea salt, I recommend using Maldon sea salt. Maldon is a finishing salt and best used just before eating. 


**Makes:** 2 large servings or 4 small servings

**Preparation time:** 10m
