Are you new to eggplant shopping? Here is how to pick a good one: choose one with firm, smooth skin that feels heavy for it’s size. Store in a cool, dry place and use within 2-3 days of purchasing. These crisps can be made ahead and stored for up to a week.

Fact: Did you know that eggplant is a fruit? Just like tomatoes, most people think they are a vegetable. 


**Makes:** 2-4 servings

**Preparation time:** 30m  
**Cooking time:** 30m  
**Total time:** 3h

**Ingredients:**

- 1 eggplant
- 1/4 cup coarse salt (e.g. kosher salt)


---

**Equipment:** wire cooling rack, parchment paper or wax paper, baking sheet 

---

**Instructions:**

1. Cut the eggplant in halve lengthwise, then with the flat side down slice then into 1/8" thick half moons.
1. Place the eggplant in a single layer on a wire cooling rack and place over the sink.
1. Sprinkle eggplant liberally with salt on both sides and let sit for 20 minutes. This technique draws a lot of the liquid out of the eggplant, but it also helps to rid the fruit of bitterness and collapses the air pockets in it.
1. Preheat the oven to 250ºF/120ºC. 
1. Rinse the eggplant pieces in cold water to wash off all the salt then gently squeeze them and dry with paper towels. 
1. Line the baking sheet (or 2) with wax paper. Lay the eggplant slices on the baking sheet(s) in a single layer and place into the oven. Cook for 1 hour, then flip all the slices over and cook for another hour and a half. Check the slices for crispiness. If they are crispy enough for you, remove them from the oven and cool on a wire rack. You can continue to cook them for another 30 minutes if you want them crispier. They will not crisp up any more as they cool. 
1. Enjoy right away or store for up to a week in an airtight container. If you store them make sure they are completely cool before putting them into the container.
