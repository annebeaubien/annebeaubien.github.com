description: A home-made sloppy joe recipe that comes with variations for vegetarians, vegans, and even those following a dairy-free, gluten-free, Paleo or Engine 2 diet!
---
Sloppy Joes are an integral part of growing up American. They are a great way of using up left-over ground meat and are a popular dish for families because they are quick and easy to make! A traditional recipe involves ground meat, ketchup, BBQ sauce and cheese. My mom always added an egg or two to help the mixture stick together better. Feel free to add an egg as long as you’re not making this vegan or Engine 2. It’s totally optional but does help make the dish a little less “sloppy”.

If you are following a special diet, make sure to get the correct type of burger buns required for that diet, i.e. for a vegan diet make sure to get vegan burger buns. You can also forgo the buns and use several pieces of iceburg lettuce to wrap the sloppy joe mixture in!

**Equipment:** blender,medium saucepan

**Instructions:**

1. If you have not done so already, cook the lentils. For detailed instructions see my post on INLINE-LINK-START title="How To: Cook Lentils" href="../../howtos/how-to-cook-lentils" target="_blank">How To: Cook Lentils INLINE-LINK-END
1. Roughly chop the onion, carrot and bell pepper and place into a blender along with the dates, Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, tomato paste, nutritional yeast, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, oregano, rosemary, and anise. 
1. Blend on high until smooth.
1. Pour the sauce and the cooked lentils into a medium sized sauce pan and heat over medium for 5-10 minutes until the sauce isn’t runny anymore and the onion is cooked. 
1. If using the option egg, crack the egg into the saucepan and quickly stir it into the sloppy joe mixture. Continue to stir until the egg is cooked through so you don't end up with egg lumps. 
1. Serve either on burger buns or wrapped in iceberg lettuce.
