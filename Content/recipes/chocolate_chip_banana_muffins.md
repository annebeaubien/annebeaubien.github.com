This banana bread is a compromise between what my kids want and what I want them to eat. It has flax seeds and whole wheat flour for me, and chocolate chips and white flour for them. A smart friend once told me that you can get kids to eat anything healthy if you just add chocolate chips and, well…it usually works. It works especially well in this recipe which is a modified version of my oatmeal banana bread.
