description: This recipe is the inspiration for the website’s name. Heart shaped waffles are a popular snack in Norway. One of the first Norwegian recipes I ever learned was this one and it was taught to me by my husband, a real waffle loving Norwegian.

In a village an hour outside of Oslo is a snow-covered, two story home with large windows and a long kitchen with lots of cupboard doors. Taped to the inside of one of those many cupboard doors is a yellowed piece of paper that has been there for nearly 20 years. On this piece of paper an 8 year old boy scribbled out his favorite recipe (oppskrift). As you have no doubt by now guessed, that recipe was for Norwegian waffles (vaffler), and the little boy is now my husband. I made a few modifications to that recipe. We bake with monk fruit sugar and use almond milk in our house but you can use regular sugar and milk. I added salt because I think this recipe was originally writen using salted butter. I also changed the vanilla sugar into vanilla extract because vanilla sugar is not easy to find outside of Norway.

**Makes:** 8 waffles

**Preparation time:** 25m  
**Cooking time:** 25m  
**Total time:** 50m

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 cup monk fruit sugar (or granulated sugar)
- 1 1/2 cup almond milk (or regular milk)
- 3 large organic eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 8 Tbsp butter, melted
- 280 grams flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cardamom
- 1/2 tsp fine salt

**Equipment:** waffle iron (a Norwegian heart shaped waffle iron works best, but use a regular American waffle iron if that’s all you have. Do not use a Belgian waffle iron, the pockets are much too deep for these waffles.)

**Instructions:**

1. In a large bowl whisk together the sugar, milk, eggs and vanilla.
1. Drizzle in the melted butter slowly while whisking.  
1. In a separate bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, cardamom and salt. 
1. Dump the dry mixture onto the wet mixture and whisk gently to combine.
1. Heat waffle iron and pour 1/3 cup batter onto waffle iron. Wait for iron to beep, them remove waffle when completely cooked. Repeat until you have used up all the batter. 
1. Top with American toppings such as blueberries and maple syrup or try some traditional Norwegian toppings...just not all at once: brown caramelized goat cheese (called Gjetost), sour cream, strawberry jam, fresh strawberries, butter and sugar, cinnamon sugar, or ice cream.
