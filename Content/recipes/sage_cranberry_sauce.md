My friend Kerri was the one who recommended making this sauce to accompany my Sweet Potato Gnocchi recipe. Of course hers had browned butter, dried cranberries and chicken stock. This slightly healthier version uses olive oil, whole cranberries, fresh sage and vegetable stock. 

**Makes:** 1 cup 

**Preparation time:** 5m  
**Cooking time:** 5m  
**Total time:** 25m

**Ingredients:**

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 cup cranberries (fresh or frozen)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh sage
- 1/4  cup toasted sliced almonds
- 2 cups low-sodium vegetable stock


---

**Equipment:** sauce pan

---

**Instructions:**

1. Heat the olive oil in a sauce pan over medium heat. 
1. Add the sage to the oil and cook it until the sage starts to get crispy. This should take 2-3 minutes. You will know it is done when the sage stops sizzling, this means all the water has been cooked out of it.
1. Immediately add the cranberries to the pan and let simmer another 1-3 minutes until the cranberries start to soften. If they are fresh they will take less time than if frozen.
1. Slowly pour in the vegetable stock and turn the heat up to medium-high. Reduce the sauce by 1/2, this should take about 10 minutes. If you want you can reduce it further until it is a bit more syrupy, it depends on what you are serving it with. If you are serving it with my [https://wafflehearts.com/recipes/sweet_potato_gnocchi](Sweet Potato Gnocchi) you do not want it to be too watery because it will dissolve the gnocchi if you use too much. 
1. Top with toasted almonds.
