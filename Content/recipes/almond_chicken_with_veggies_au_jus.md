The title says it all. This is a flavorful, vegetable, chicken and almond stew that is served in its own juices. It can be served all year and is great for cold winter nights when you want something hearty but healthy. Likewise it’s light enough to be enjoyed spring or summer with a nice dry white wine. 

If you do not have a rutabaga you can use a potato instead.

**Ingredients:**

- 4 shiitake mushrooms 
- 1/2 pound rutabaga

- 1 large zucchini
- 2 tablespoon almond oil (or olive oil; divided)
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into 2-3" pieces )

**Equipment:** large saucepan with lid

---

**Instructions:**

1. Wash the mushrooms by placing them in a bowl full of water and letting all of the dirt fall to the bottom of the bowl. Then scoop the mushrooms from the top of the water, dry thoroughly with paper towels and slice into bite-sized pieces. 
1. Wash, peel and dice the rutabaga and carrot. Wash and dice the zucchini.
1. Heat 1 tablespoon almond oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Sauté the mushrooms, rutabaga, carrot and zucchini for 3-5 minutes. Stir frequently to keep them from burning. 
1. Remove the veggies to a large bowl. 
1. Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, heat over medium high and add the chicken. Brown the chicken on all sides (3-5 minutes).
1. Stir in the stock, almonds, oregano and sauteed veggies. You want everything just barely covered by the stock.
1. Cover and simmer on low until the rutabaga is tender and the chicken is cooked through (10-15 minutes). 
1. Just before serving, stir in the greens and season with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Enjoy!
