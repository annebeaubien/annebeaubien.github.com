description: Summer is coming to an end but you can make it last a little bit longer with this tropical smoothie.

We may be in the last week of summer but it sure doesn’t seem like it. I’m currently visiting my mom in Virginia where we are having 94ºF days with a heat index over 100ºF!! This weather is definitely an appetite killer, however ice cold smoothies are always a welcome respite from the heat. Check out this tropical smoothie and enjoy the last moments of summer. It helps to imagine you are lying on the beach of an exotic island in the caribbean. 

Note: if following a gout diet, make sure to use kale instead of spinach.
