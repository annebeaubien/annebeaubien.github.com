Who wants to cook a big meal in the days after Thanksgiving or Christmas? Not me, that’s for sure. Luckily this quick recipe can be made with left-over holiday turkey, rotisserie chicken, or cooked chicken breasts. The only real prep here is chopping an onion and some garlic. That’s it. You just toss everything into a slow cooker, turn it on, go for a brisk fall hike and come home to a delicious, hearty warm stew.
