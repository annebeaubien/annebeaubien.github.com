I decided to try making it without sugar and guess what? It turned out great! It didn’t need the refined sugar at all, just more bananas! I also was trying to find a way to add oatmeal to this bread when I came across a new discovery...oat flour!<br><br>Whether you choose to make a banana bread loaf, muffins, mini-muffins or some other crazy shape it doesn’t matter, this recipe works for all of the above. <em>Note about oat flour</em> In the instructions I tell you how to make the oat flour using a blender and rolled oats. It is very easy to do and the best option if you are making this recipe gluten-free. Alternatively you can buy oat flour as is, but it is difficult to find gluten-free oat flour. Oats and oat flour is naturally gluten-free but it is usually processed on the same machines as grains that contain gluten so there can be cross contamination unless you buy oats that are sold as “gluten-free”. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers gluten-free oats. Also, this recipe measures the oats by weight, but if you don't have a kitchen scale you can use volume, but it won't be as accurate. 12 ounces of oat flour is about 3 cups.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1 loaf, 20 muffins, 48 mini-muffins</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>6 ripe bananas (medium - large)</li><li>2 organic eggs</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li><li>12 ounces rolled oats (or oat flour - if making this recipe gluten-free make sure to get gluten-free rolled oats)</li><li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li><li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1/2 cup plain applesauce (or softened butter if you’re feeling naughty - just know that this swap adds 800 calories and 90 grams of fat)</li><li>1 cup chopped walnuts/almonds/raisins (optional)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> large bowl, medium bowl, blender, scale, baking vessel of your choice</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/177ºC and prepare your baking vessel (e.g. loaf pan, muffin cups)</li><li>In a large bowl mash the bananas with a fork until all the chunks are gone. You can either use a fork or a potato masher. Then mix in the applesauce, eggs, vanilla and almond extracts. Set aside.</li><li>If using rolled oats, place them into a blender and puree until all of the oats are completely chopped up and resemble flour. Now you have oat flour. Depending on your blender you may want to only blend 4 ounces at a time.</li><li>Place the oat flour into a medium-sized bowl. Then add the baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and sift these dry ingredients together.</li><li>Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until it is all incorporated.</li><li>Fold in the chopped nuts and/or raisins if using.</li><li>Pour the batter into prepared loaf pan, muffin cups or mini-muffin cups.</li><li>Bake at 350 until a toothpick inserted in comes out clean.
