If you do not have a Dutch oven that is ok, you can use a regular casserole dish as long as you have either a tight fitting lid for it or some aluminum foil. This dish is built up in layers just like lasagna, so each time you see a new ingredient try to create a complete layer by it spreading across the entire surface of the layer underneath it. I like to use hearty greens in this dish, you can use just one or mixture of several. Hearty greens are those that can stand up to heat and not disintegrate, for example: arugula, chard, collard greens, kale or spinach</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4-6</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h10m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 yam (pick one that does not narrow at the ends as much)</li><li>10 Brussels sprouts</li><li>1 small red onion</li><li>1 yellow summer squash</li><li>2 cups cauliflower</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li><li>2 teaspoons dried rosemary (optional)</li><li>6 ounces Muenster cheese (or 6 slices)</li><li>1/4 cup low-sodium vegetable stock</li><li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li><li>2 cups hearty greens (arugula, chard, collard greens, kale or spinach)</li><li>1 teaspoon avocado oil</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Dutch oven or casserole dish</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat the oven to 425ºF/220ºC.</li><li>Prepare all of the veggies and place them into separate prep bowls. Peel the yam and slice into 1/4” rounds. Chop the greens in to 1” bite-sized pieces. Slice the Brussels sprouts into 1/4” rounds. Dice the onion. Cut the cauliflower into 1/2” pieces. Slice the yellow squash into 1/4” thick half moons by cutting in half lengthwise then cutting perpendicularly.</li><li>Add the avocado oil to the dutch oven, use a papertowel to spread it around evenly until all the sides are well coated then shingle half of the yams on the bottom so that they overlap just slightly and cover the bottom.</li><li>Spread half of the collard greens onto the yams.</li><li>Fan out the sliced Brussels sprouts next. You probably will not have quite enough to shingle them so just spread them out evenly.</li><li>Sprinkle on half of the diced onion, then season with a little salt, pepper, and half of the rosemary.</li><li>Lay the slices of muenster down next.</li><li>Top the Muenster with the chopped cauliflower.</li><li>Spread the rest of the greens out.</li><li>Layer the yellow squash half moons on top of the collards.</li><li>Sprinkle on the rest of the onion.</li><li>Shingle the rest of the yams on top and try to make it look nice. This is the top of the dish that everyone will see.</li><li>Pour 1/4 cup of vegetable stock all over the dish making sure it runs down the sides toward the bottom.</li><li>Season with salt, pepper and the rest of the dried rosemary.</li><li>Finally, sprinkle the Parmesan cheese on top and cover. Place into the preheated oven and cook for 20 minutes covered then another 20 minutes uncovered. The dish is done when the yams are cooked through and the cheese on top is bubbly.</li><li>To serve, let it cool for 5 minutes then slice it and serve it in wedges like a cake.</li></ol><p>Camping Tip: This is a great recipe for camping because you can prep everything before you go and throw it all together at the campsite. Just make sure you have a fire proof Dutch oven and a really nice big fire going so that it cooks quickly enough. You will want to eliminate the uncovered portion of cooking and cook covered the entire time. If you can place hot coals on top of the lid during cooking this is recommended. The dish is done when you can easily pierce the yams on top with a fork.</p><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2022 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
