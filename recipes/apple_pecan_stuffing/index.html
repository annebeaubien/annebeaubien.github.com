Unfortunately certain members of my family (not to be named) refuse to eat key ingredients in the stuffing that I grew up with and love (my mom’s recipe) which is why I have this dilemma. Finally, after piecing together bits of my mom’s stuffing with several others we have tried over the years this dish has finally emerged. The apples give it a great tart/sweet flavor while the pecans add an irresistible nutty crunch. I have made it for two years in a row now with not a single complaint, and in fact many compliments, so I feel it is finally ready to share. Stuffing in name only this recipe is actually baked in a medium-sized baking dish in the oven…not in a turkey. You can of course put it in your turkey if you wish but it will add cooking time to the turkey.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 8 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h20m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 medium sourdough bread loaf (or gluten-free bread if making this recipe gluten-free)</li><li>5 tablespoons butter (divided)</li><li>1 cup chopped celery</li><li>1 cup chopped shallots</li><li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh sage</li><li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh marjoram (or oregano)</li><li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme (woody stems removed)</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons coarse salt</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li><li>2 cooking apples (Braeburn, Honey Crisp, Pink Lady or Granny Smith)</li><li>2 eggs</li><li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley (Plus a little extra for garnish)</li><li>2 cups chopped pecans</li><li>1 1/2 cups turkey stock (if making this vegetarian use vegetable stock, if making gluten-free make sure to get gluten-free stock)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> saucepan, large bowl, small bowl, 9x9 baking dish</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 300ºF/150ºC.</li><li>Slice the bread into 1” slices. Then spread out the slices into a single later in the oven and cook until the bread is dried out. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Carefully remove the bread from the oven and let it cool. Then cut or tear the bread into bite-sized pieces and place them into a large mixing bowl. Turn the oven temperature up to 375ºF/150ºC.</li><li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Then add the celery, shallots, sage, marjoram, thyme, salt and pepper and sauté for 3-5 minutes until the shallots soften. Remove the mixture from the pan and pour it onto the bread pieces.</li><li>Chop the apples into 1/2-inch cubes.</li><li>Heat the saucepan over medium heat again and melt the last tablespoon of butter. As soon as it is melted add the cubed apples and sauté them for 3-5 minutes until they soften. Add the cooked apples to the bread mixture.</li><li>In a separate bowl whisk the eggs, then add the parsley. Pour this over the bread mixture. Add the pecans and toss everything together.</li><li>Drizzle about 1 cup of turkey (or vegetable) stock over the stuffing mixture then toss again. You want it to be soggy but not have a lot of excess liquid. Continue adding stock until you achieve this moisture level.</li><li>Place the stuffing into a baking dish, cover and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the cover and bake another 20 minutes to crisp up the edges of the bread.</li><li>Garnish with a bit of chopped parsley and serve warm.</li></ol><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2024 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
