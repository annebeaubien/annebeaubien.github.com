It was Christmas of 2007 and I was living in southern England. I was at a Christmas choir concert with another American friend of mine and it was intermission. We wandered around and discovered that they were serving mulled wine and mincemeat pies. Yum! Now that I think of it, that was the first time I ever had mulled wine too. What a great introduction to this integral part of English culture. Traditionally mincemeat pies contain suet or some other form of animal fat but my recipe is completely vegetarian and even includes a reduced-calorie option. These pies can be made with or without a crust. For less calories use individual ramekins (about 4oz each) to replace the crust. If you want to use a crust you can use either puff pastry or pie dough. Mince pies are usually individually sized, so a muffin tin or mini-muffin tin both work well. Just grease the tins and press the puff pastry/pie dough into them. <em>If you are making this recipe gluten free, make sure to buy gluten free pie crust or skip the pie crust and use the ramekins.</em>If you are making this recipe vegan, make sure to buy vegan pie crust or skip the pie crust and use the ramekins This mince mixture requires 2 cups of dried fruit. I like to use 3/4 cup raisins, 1/2 cup currants, 1/2 cup sultanas and 1/4 cup goji berries. Feel free to use whatever combination you want as long as it adds up to 2 cups.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4 cups of pie filling (about 8 muffin sized/20 mini-muffin sized)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 8h30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 8h30m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 9h</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>2 cups dried fruit (raisins, currants, sultanas, goji berries)</li><li>2 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut</li><li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg (or 1/2 tsp if using pre-ground)</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground clove</li><li>zest and juice of 1 orange (1/4 cup juice)</li><li>zest and juice of 1 lemon (1 tablespoon juice)</li><li>1/4 cup Grand Marnier</li><li>2 cups unsweetened applesauce</li><li>puff pastry or pie crust (optional)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Mix the dried fruit, coconut, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, orange zest, 1/4 cup orange juice, lemon zest, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and cognac.
