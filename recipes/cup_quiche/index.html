You can easily customize them by adding cheese or meat to some while leaving others dairy-free and vegetarian. You can also make a bunch of these at the beginning of the week and reheat them as needed for a quick breakfast or snack. I recommend using a greased muffin tin, but if you prefer you can try paper muffin cups. I must warn you that every time I tried muffin cups the paper stuck to the quiches because there’s not enough fat in them. You can also use silicon cupcake molds, which work great and you don't have to grease them! Tip: When buying frozen spinach try to buy it in a bag not a box. The boxed is more difficult to use because the entire block must be defrosted in order to use. Bagged spinach can be used as needed.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 12 mini quiches</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 30m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 large carrot</li><li>1 large zucchini</li><li>1 small shallot</li><li>6 organic eggs</li><li>3 tablespoons unsweetened milk substitute (unsweetened coconut, soy, almond, etc)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li>1 teaspoon you favorite dried herb (rosemary, oregano, etc.)</li><li>1/2 cup frozen chopped spinach</li><li>1 tablespoon avocado oil (plus more to grease the baking dish)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> skillet, muffin tin or silicon cupcake molds</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 425ºF/220ºC, and prepare your muffin tin/silicon cupcake molds. If using silicon molds you might not have to use any oil, muffin tins will require just a bit. I recommend avocado oil as olive oil should not be heated over 400ºF.</li><li>Dice the carrot, zucchini and shallot.</li><li>Heat the avocado oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sweat the chopped carrot, zucchini and shallot for about 5-10 minutes until they soften up a bit. Then remove from heat and let them cool for a couple of minutes while you get the eggs ready.</li><li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk substitute, spinach, salt, pepper and any dried herbs you would like to use. The dried herbs are optional. I like to combine a half teaspoon of rosemary and a half teaspoon of oregano.</li><li>Add the sautéed veggies to the bowl with the eggs and stir the ingredients together.</li><li>Pour a little of the egg mixture into each muffin cup. You want to leave about a 1/2 inch of space for each one because the quiches will rise; you don’t want them to spill over the edge of the tin.</li><li>Bake at 425ºF/220ºC for 20-22 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. You just need to cook them long enough so the eggs are cooked through.</li><li>Remove the muffin tin from the oven and use a spatula to loosen the quiches from the sides of the pan, then carefully scoop them out onto a wire rack.</li><li>Eat while warm or refrigerate and heat them up one and a time as needed. They will keep in the fridge for up to a week.</li></ol><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/dairy-free">Dairy Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2024 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
