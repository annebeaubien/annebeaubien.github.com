You can make the mix up ahead and keep it in the fridge until you need it, and you can use leftovers to make it. I have written it as if you are starting from scratch but feel free to replace whatever you want with leftovers that you already have.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 50m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 50m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h30m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>4-8 tablespoons unsweetened organic soy milk</li><li>1 pound russet potatoes</li><li>1/2 cup diced onion</li><li>1 garlic clove (diced)</li><li>1/4 pound ground lamb</li><li>1/2 cup peas</li><li>1/2 cup diced carrots</li><li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li>1/4 teaspoon celery seed</li><li>1/4 teaspoon celery flake</li><li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li><li>1/4 teaspoon garlic granules</li><li>1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary</li><li>1/4 cup dry green lentils (or 1/2 cup cooked)</li><li>1/4 teaspoon coarse salt (e.g. kosher salt)</li><li>1/2 cup low-sodium vegetable stock</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> 10 oz ramekins (one per person), piping bag and medium sized tip (recommended), potato masher (recommended)</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Wash, peel and chop the potatoes into roughly equal sized pieces, about an inch large. Place in a medium saucepan and cover with water. Turn on the burner to high and bring to a boil then reduce to simmer for about 30 minutes. (For more detailed instructions see my post on<a href="https://wafflehearts.com/howtos/how-to-make-mashed-potatoes"> How To: Make Mashed Potatoes</a>)</li><li>Meanwhile, if you haven’t cooked the lentils yet you can do that while the potatoes are cooking. Place the lentils in a saucepan with water in the ration of 1 part lentils to 3 parts water, simmer for 25 minutes. (For more detailed instructions see my post on<a href="https://wafflehearts.com/howtos/how-to-cook-lentils"> How To: Cook Lentils</a>)</li><li>While the potatoes and lentils are cooking you can sauté the onions and garlic and brown the lamb. To do this spray a skillet with non-stick spray and heat over medium-high. When the skillet is hot add the onions and garlic and sauté until they are translucent. Then add the ground lamb and break it up using a spatula. Once the meat is cooked through pour the onion, garlic and lamb into a large bowl.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 400ºF/200ºC</li><li>Check on the mashed potatoes and lentils. Once they are cooked put the mashed potatoes in a separate medium-sized bowl and mash them with a potato masher. Once you have worked out all the lumps then measure out the amount of mash you have. You will need at least 1/2 cup for each ramekin. Add 2 tablespoons of soy milk for each 1/2 cup of mash, and salt to taste. Then place the potatoes into piping bags affixed with a medium sized piping tip (if using). I recommend the Wilton size 21, 22, or 199. Set aside.</li><li>Once the lentils are cooked through drain off any excess water and pour the lentils into the large bowl with the onion mixture.</li><li>Add the peas, carrots and all the spices to the large bowl and mix it well. Do not add the vegetable stock yet.</li><li>Spray 2 ramekins with non-stick spray and spoon the large bowl mixture evenly into each one. Now add 1/4 cup vegetable stock to each ramekin.</li><li>Take the mashed potatoes and either spoon them on top or pipe them onto the ramekins in a nice pattern moving up and down in short bursts.</li><li>Place the ramekins into the upper part of the oven and bake for 10 minutes at 400ºF/200ºC. Then without removing the ramekins reduce the oven heat to 350ºF/175ºC and continue to bake for another 30 min.</li><li>Remove from the oven and let them sit for 5 minutes before eating. Enjoy!</li></ol><ul><li>According to the Food Lover's Companion by Sharon Tyler Herbst and Ron Herbst Shepherd's pie just before mashed potatoes are piped on. ￼ With mashed potatoes on top before baking ￼</li></ul><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/dairy-free">Dairy Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2025 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
