Taped to the inside of one of those many cupboard doors is a yellowed piece of paper that has been there for nearly 20 years. On this piece of paper an 8 year old boy scribbled out his favorite recipe (oppskrift). As you have no doubt by now guessed, that recipe was for Norwegian waffles (vaffler), and the little boy is now my husband. I made a few modifications to that recipe. We bake with monk fruit sugar and use almond milk in our house but you can use regular sugar and milk. I added salt because I think this recipe was originally writen using salted butter. I also changed the vanilla sugar into vanilla extract because vanilla sugar is not easy to find outside of Norway.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 8 waffles</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 25m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 25m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 50m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/2 cup monk fruit sugar (or granulated sugar)</li><li>1 1/2 cup almond milk (or regular milk)</li><li>3 large organic eggs</li><li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li><li>8 Tbsp butter, melted</li><li>280 grams flour</li><li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li><li>1/2 tsp fine salt</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> waffle iron (a Norwegian heart shaped waffle iron works best, but use a regular American waffle iron if that’s all you have.
