You put it in the slow-cooker the night before so it is ready by the time you wake up. This also works well if you have kids or house guests and need a quick breakfast in the morning. I tested this recipe with both rolled oats and steel cut oats. The rolled oats pretty much disintegrated after 6 hours in the slow cooker so it made a big bowl of mush. It was still tasty but didn’t quite have the desired texture. Therefore, I recommend using steel cut oats. They hold together better and give it a nice chewy texture. You can grease the sides of the slow-cooker before you add the ingredients if you wish, but it is not necessary. The oatmeal will probably stick to the sides a little, depending on your slow-cooker. I’d recommend using a little non-stick spray or coconut oil if you use anything, but don’t feel like you have to, I never do. *Gluten-Free: oats are naturally gluten-free, however they are usually processed on the same equipment as wheat and other gluten containing grains. If you are following a strict gluten-free diet then make sure to buy gluten-free oats. Bob’s Red Mill is one company that offers them. If you only have a minor gluten allergy then you may be fine with regular oats.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 10 cups (about 8 servings)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 8h20m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup shredded carrot (1-3 large carrots)</li><li>1 cup shredded zucchini (1-2 large zucchini)</li><li>2 cups steel cut oats (gluten-free if desired)</li><li>1 cup frozen kale</li><li>2 cups unsweetened coconut milk</li><li>7 cups water</li><li>8 pitted dates (chopped)</li><li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract (or 1 teaspoon almond extract and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)</li><li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li><li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>1/2 cup toasted coconut (optional)</li><li>1/2 cup toasted nuts (optional)</li><li>1/2 cup raisins (optional)</li><li>1/2 cup ground flax seeds (If you add more than 1/4 cup add a little extra water)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> slow cooker</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>First, you need to chop/shred the carrot and zucchini. You can do this several ways, either: 1. use a knife and cut into small pieces, 2. use a cheese grater to shred it, 3. place them into a blender/food processor and use the chop setting.</li><li>Place the shredded carrot and zucchini into a slow cooker, along with the oats, kale, coconut milk, water, chopped dates, ground flax seeds, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and nutmeg.</li><li>Cook on low for 6-8 hours (depending on your slow-cooker). Some slow-cookers are hotter than others, and some have a "keep warm" setting. If yours has a "keep warm" setting that kicks in automatically after the cooking time finishes, then I recommend using this and setting the timer for 6 hours. That way it'll still be warm when you get up after a full night's sleep.</li><li>Serve with toasted coconut, toasted nuts and raisins and let people add as much as they want. I add about 1 tablespoon of each (coconut, nuts and raisins) to each serving.</li></ol><p>My recipe was inspired by the “Vegan Carrot Cake &amp; Zucchini Bread Oatmeal” recipe from Kathy Hester's cookbook, The Vegan Slow Cooker.</p><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/dairy-free">Dairy Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegan">Vegan</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2022 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
