For less than 300 calories, this blueberry smoothie fills your daily requirements for vitamins A and K. It has 60% RDA of manganese, almost 50% RDA of folate, fiber and vitamin B12, and 25% RDA of potassium, calcium and magnesium. Whew! Now that is what I call a super smoothie! *You probably noticed that I called this a green smoothie even though it is not green in color. Green smoothies have greens in them, like spinach, kale, chard or collards.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 1</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 2m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 2m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 2m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1/2 cup frozen kale</li><li>1 medium banana (peeled)</li><li>1 cup frozen blueberries</li><li>1 cup unsweetened coconut milk</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> blender</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Place all of the ingredients into a blender and process on high until smooth.</li><li>Drink.</li><li>Exercise.</li></ol><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/dairy-free">Dairy Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegan">Vegan</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>Â© 2011 - 2023 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
