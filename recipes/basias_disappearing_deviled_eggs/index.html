It comes from my best friend’s mom. She's an adorable little Polish woman who is an amazing cook. She is actually the one who taught me that it is possible to make mashed potatoes that don’t come from a box! But back to the eggs. I made these for my husband’s 30th birthday party for a crowd of deviled egg connoisseurs. Well I made the filling, and someone else boiled the eggs. We mixed the egg yolks and filling together but by the time I realized what had happened it was too late. I had made enough filling for 24 eggs and she had only boiled 12! So we ended up with double strength deviled eggs…which turned out to be a huge hit! They disappeared within 10 minutes and everyone who got one loved them. We even had some comments along the lines of “best deviled eggs they'd ever had” and lots of people asking for the recipe. For those of you who have been waiting for it, here it is. Enjoy! Feel free to make these as written or cut the ingredients (except the eggs) in half and make them like Basia does. If you make them as written they really have a kick. Basia way is a bit milder.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 6 deviled eggs (12 halves)</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 22m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>6 organic eggs</li><li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li><li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li><li>4 teaspoons prepared horseradish</li><li>1 teaspoon dry mustard powder</li><li>salt and pepper (to taste)</li><li>paprika (garnish)</li><li>fresh chives (garnish)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> medium-large saucepan, large bowl, medium bowl, sifter (optional), piping bag and tip (optional)</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Fill a medium to large saucepan with enough water to cover all of the eggs by at least an inch. With just water in the pan bring the water to a boil over high heat.</li><li>Pierce a small hole in the bottom of each egg with a sterilized pin. Then gently place the eggs into the boiling water. Boil for 12-14 minutes (depending on the size of the eggs), set a timer so you don’t overcook them.</li><li>Fill a large bowl with ice cold water.</li><li>When the timer goes off on the eggs use a slotted spoon to remove them from the boiling water and immediately immerse them in the cold water.</li><li>Once the eggs are cool (about 10 minutes) peel them and discard the shells.</li><li>Slice the eggs in half lengthwise and put the yolks into a medium bowl. Set the eggs whites into a storage or serving container (depending on if you are serving right away or storing for later).</li><li>Use a fork to mash the yolks. To make the filling smooth enough to put through a piping bag you should mash the yolks through a mesh strainer. This will remove the lumps.</li><li>Add the mayonnaise, vinegar, horseradish and dry mustard powder to the medium bowl. Mix well, then season to taste with salt and pepper.</li><li>Place the filling into a piping bag with a decorate tip. If you are storing these for later you can store the filling in the piping bag. Just before serving, place the eggs whites in a serving dish, then pipe some filling into each one. Garnish with a little paprika and sliced chives and serve.</li></ol><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/dairy-free">Dairy Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2024 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
