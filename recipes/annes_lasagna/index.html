I live in California where the growing season never really ends so for me many vegetables are available locally-grown and organic all year. However if you live somewhere with more prominent seasons, then use the vegetables that are available during the season when you are making this. For example when it is spring or summer you should make this with zucchini, yellow summer squash, green beans and asparagus. Similarly during the winter you could make it with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and Brussels sprouts.</p><p>This makes a great vegetarian lasagna provided you use a good variety of vegetables and leave out the lamb. As always, make sure to buy rennet-free cheeses if you want it to be truly vegetarian.</p><p>If you are making this recipe gluten-free, make sure you get gluten-free lasagna noodles as well as pasta sauce and spices. Some sauces and spices use wheat as a filler so make sure to read those labels.</p><p>Also there is no need to pre-cook the noodles, they will cook in the lasagna. Just make sure to use a sauce with a bit of liquid to it, in other words, do not use a marinara sauce.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 6 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 20m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h40m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>2 cups low-fat cottage cheese</li><li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li><li>2 cups hearty greens (arugula/chard/collard greens/kale/spinach/etc)</li><li>1 cup shredded mozzarella (about 8 oz)</li><li>whole grain lasagna noodles (gluten-free: use gluten-free lasagna noodles and follow box instructions for pre-cooking)</li><li>1/2 yellow onion (diced)</li><li>1 pound ground lamb (vegetarian: leave this out)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt (e.g. kosher salt)</li><li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning (or 1/2 teaspoon each: dried basil and dried oregano, plus 1/4 teaspoon each: onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary and black pepper)</li><li>4 cups diced mixed vegetables (use what is in season: asparagus/broccoli/carrots/cauliflower/Brussels sprouts/summer squash/zucchini)</li><li>3 cups pasta sauce (divided)</li><li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Large baking dish, skillet, large bowl</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Preheat oven to 375ºF/190ºC.</li><li>Heat 1 tablespoon avocado oil in a skillet over medium heat, then add the onion, ground lamb, salt and dried spices. Cook until the lamb is browned.</li><li>Meanwhile wash and chop the vegetables into bite-sized pieces.</li><li>Add the vegetables and half the pasta sauce to the lamb and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes until the veggies soften.</li><li>Assemble the layers of the lasagna. Spread the ingredients of each layer out evenly. Starting from the bottom up the layers are:</li><li>1/2 cup pasta sauce</li><li>single layer of lasagna noodles</li><li>vegetables and meat mixture</li><li>single layer of lasagna noodles</li><li>cottage cheese</li><li>parmesan cheese</li><li>greens</li><li>single layer of lasagna noodles</li><li>1 cup pasta sauce</li><li>shredded mozzarella</li><li>Check the your lasagna noodle box for baking times as this will vary, but for the most part I always bake the lasagna uncovered for 40 minutes, then remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving, and this always works.</li><li>Serve hot accompanied by a Caesar salad and a glass of your favorite wine. You’ve earned it.</li></ol><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2024 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
