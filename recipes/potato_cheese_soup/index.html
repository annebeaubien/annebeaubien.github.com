I said complete protein. Only 1 tablespoon on nutritional yeast has 8 grams of protein and all of the essential amino acids! In addition, it is an excellent source of B vitamins, which is good news for vegetarians who often have trouble getting enough in their diets.</p><p>Nutritional yeast is fungus (think teeny, tiny mushrooms) that grows on sugarcane and beet molasses. It is fed with B vitamins until it is harvested and deactivated. Because it is deactivated it can be enjoyed by those who have a yeast allergy.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 2 main course or 4 appetizer</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 5m<br><strong>Total time:</strong> 1h5m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 medium russet potato (chopped into 2" pieces)</li><li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast (45g)</li><li>2 medium roasted red peppers (120g)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li><li>1 cup broccoli (optional)</li><li>1 cup spinach (optional)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt (e.g. kosher salt)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Vitamix or regular blender</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Put the chopped potatoes and 4 cups of water into a large sauce pan.</li><li>Turn the heat on to high and bring to a boil (about 15 mins). Once boiling, turn the heat down to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes more. The potatoes are done when they completely fall apart.</li><li>Pour the potatoes and water into a blender. Add the nutritional yeast, roasted red peppers, onion powder and salt to the blender; puree until smooth.</li><li>Taste to see if you want to add more salt, you can do that now. You can also add some pepper at this point.</li><li>If you are using the broccoli, spinach or other veggies cut them into 2” pieces and put them into the blender with the soup.</li><li>Vitamix: process on setting 4 for 30 seconds to chop of veggies. Regular blender: pulse until veggies are chopped up or process on low. You can also just chop the veggies up with a knife and add to the finished soup.</li><li>Put the soup back into the saucepan and heat up to desired temp then enjoy!</li></ol><ul id="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/dairy-free">Dairy Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/gluten-free">Gluten Free</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegan">Vegan</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vegetarian">Vegetarian</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><hr/><p>Created using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a>, <a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p><p><b>© 2011 - 2024 Anne (Beaubien) Jensen</b>  All Rights Reserved.</p></footer></div></div></body></html>
