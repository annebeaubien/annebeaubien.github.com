Pepperkaker and gløgg to be more precise. When you go buy a Christmas tree there is a table with free pepperkaker and gløgg. When you go into shops there is a little bowl of pepperkaker by the door. When you go to see Nøtteknekkeren at the opera (and you must!) they have pint sized ballerinas handing it out at intermission. It wouldn’t be Christmas in Norway without pepperkaker. Most people make their own AND buy store bought. That’s because most of the recipes are not very good. Rolling out and stamping the cookies with kids is a tradition that everyone does. The kids even do it at school. I have never seen such adept bakers in my life as Norwegian toddlers rolling out and stamping their own gingerbread cookies. However, for the dough to be so workable by little hands it is often a bit tough and slightly too thick. So people usually buy the pepperkaker they want to eat. I now present you with the most delicious and totally workable recipe for pepperkaker! This dough rolls out beautifully, and it tastes amazing! The key is to get it thin enough and not burn it. Pepperkaker should have a snap to it.</p><p>Note: I don’t recommend this recipe for making gingerbread houses, it is a bit too soft to hold up for very long.</p><p>A note on substitutions: If you substitute honey for the corn syrup it makes the cookies softer. If you substitute gluten free flour these are easier to roll out but they are also softer. I have not found a butter substitute that is sufficient to make these completely dairy free, but you can replace the cream with soy milk without too much trouble.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> about 40 4inch gingerbread men</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 1h 30m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 10m<br><strong>Total Time:</strong> 1h 40m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>250 grams butter (a little over two sticks)</li><li>150 grams light corn syrup</li><li>255 grams sugar</li><li>150 grams cream</li><li>580 all purpose flour</li><li>3/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li><li>3/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>1 teaspoon ground pepper</li><li>3 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li><li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> cookie cutters</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Combine the butter, honey and sugar in a saucepan.

Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 350ºF/175ºC then roll out, stamp shapes and bake. If the dough has gotten too cold then it will be tricky to roll out, we like to hit it with the rolling pin to flatten it (because it’s fun) then roll and turn a bunch of times. You can also take off smaller balls and warm them up in your hands and knead them a few times before rolling out. Use flour when rolling out and make sure to put down a little flour just after the last roll so that the cookies don’t stick to the counter after you’ve stamped them.</li><li>Bake small cookies (1-2") for 10 minutes. Bake large cookies (4-6") for 12-14 minutes. They are done baking when they start to change color at the edges, but are not too dark. It just takes buring one batch to know what too dark is :)...if they are not done in the suggested times then they are too thick.</li></ol><p>350ºF</p><p>10m - small cookies</p><p>12-14m - large cookies</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://your-website-url.com/recipes/risengrynsgroet</guid><title>Risengrynsgrøt</title><description>Literally “rice grain porridge” this creamy, cinnamon sugar porridge is enjoyed mostly as lunch on Christmas Eve but also sometimes throughout the month at gatherings.</description><link>https://your-website-url.com/recipes/risengrynsgroet</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have never played a Christmas Eve game involving a pot of porridge and a marzipan pig then you need to read this recipe. Literally “rice grain porridge” this creamy, cinnamon sugar porridge is enjoyed mostly as lunch on Christmas Eve but also sometimes throughout the month at gatherings. To play the Christmas Eve porridge game you put a peeled almond into the serving pot. Then everyone takes a scoop and whoever gets the almond wins a marzipan pig! Make sure to make enough extra so that you can leave a bowl of porridge out for the nisse on the night of the 24th of December. Nisse are naughty elves that live in the woods and they cause mischief in your house if you don’t bribe them with a bowl of porridge. The nisse are also the ones in charge of washing and caring for the Christmas pig…pork belly is the main dish for many Norwegian Christmas dinners…which is probably why the marzipan is shaped like a pig.</p><p>The way you eat this is just as important as the way you make it! Once you have your bowl of porridge in front of you, make a well in the center and put in a dollop of butter. Then cover the whole bowl with cinnamon sugar. As you begin to eat make sure to get a small piece of butter in each bite.</p><p><strong>Makes:</strong> 4-6 servings</p><p><strong>Preparation time:</strong> 2m<br><strong>Cooking time:</strong> 1h<br><strong>Total Time:</strong> 1h 2m</p><hr><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup arborio rice (risotto rice)</li><li>2 cups water</li><li>4 cups whole milk</li><li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li><li>1 vanilla bean</li><li>butter (1/2-1 tablespoon per person)</li><li>cinnamon sugar (to taste)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> rice cooker or stock pot</p><hr><p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p><ol><li>Place the rice, water, milk and salt in a rice cooker. Then split the vanilla bean down the middle and scrape the beans into the rice cooker then place the whole bean in there as well. Turn it on the white rice setting. Stir every 10 minutes just to make sure the bottom is not burning. Add more water as needed. *If making this in a stock pot you will have to keep a close eye on it so it does not boil over or burn so cook it over low heat. It is done when the rice is cooked through. It should be a little soupy, it is porridge after all.</li><li>If you are playing the game then take an almond, put it in a small bowl and pour boiling water over it. Wait a few minutes then fish it out of the bowl and the skin should slip right off. Put it into the serving bowl.</li><li>Scoop your serving of the porridge into a bowl, then make a small well in the middle of the porridge. Put a dab (about 1/2 tbsp) of butter into the well. Then sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the entire top.</li><li>This part is very important! Do not mix everything together! Your Norwegian friends will never forgive you. When you eat risengrynsgrøt you take your spoon and dig into part of the butter, then continue down into the porridge. You are meant to have a small piece of butter with every bite.</li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
